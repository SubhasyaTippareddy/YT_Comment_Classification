69,hi jenny  for every other dp problem we need to create a table in somewhat different way like in some example we take the value of upper row and in some problem we are taking the value of the same row  and in some example we are starting with  0  index and not in other  is there any logic behind it  and is there are any finite set of way to create this respective table because if we are able to create the table in correct way we can create the logic easily  please let us know about it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

84,dp is actually  optimized recursion  or you can say its a second name for  recursion  it is basically solving a problem recursively  by giving an  inductive definition  to the problem  it is a step ahead of plain recursion in that sense that we  optimize the complex recursive program  having multiple nested recursions  by eliminating repetitive calls to the recursive functions  the approach to problem solving in dp is same as that of recursion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

331,excellent video  but i do have one suggestion  although the algorithm part is perfectly executed but for the coding part  i think we should avoid using a matrix  table  for calculation  because when we think about it  for calculating one particular row  we only need the previous row  and the rows behind were just taking extra space for no reason  python program       def change self  amount  int  coins  list int   > int          dp    0     amount 1          dp 0    1         for c in coins              for i in range c  amount 1                  dp i    dp i c          return dp 1  we also do not really need to check for condition  because  just by following the procedure  everything aligns automatically  so conclusion  by using a single dimenstional array instead of a matrix  we can reduce the space complexity from o m   n   where  m  is the range from  0 amount  and  n  is the no of coins that are given to us  to o m  hope it helps  there is a leetcode problem on the name coin change   ii  so practice that too for further clearity ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

569,correct  even i also got stuck in same place   jenny   you should 1st explain the logic behind this problem that how to deduce the formula instead of just writting the code using formulas ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

572, 20 36 the value of i is 0 for first iteration  coins i >j this condition will implement but as the value of i is 0  what will be value of a i 1 j can we add the first row of coins as zeroes and then we change the for loop iteration for i as i 1  please reply  pardon my english ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

865,intuitively you can say that the no  of ways of amt x    no  of ways of amt  x  without using the current coin   no  of ways using the current coin so in no  of ways using current coin it is obvious that current coin  is included  so now we remove the coin value from that amt so new amt become  amt   val now we calc the  amt  val  using the coins till current value which is why we trace back j valur by coins i  i know this sounds a bit confusing,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1069,perfect explanation but one thing missed here if suppose we do not have 1 rs  coin means if i have coins   4  10  25  and amt  41 how to calculate this matrix there should always be one row with 0 coin which can have max infinity solns for each amount except 0 which would have 0 solns only  i think that is should include in this video just my advice   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1070, 49sandeep  yes actually i also checked that but instead of initialising the whole 2d matrix with 0 you can try initialising with int max  and when you will find min int max   x  you will get the correct answer  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1466,hi jenny  thanks for the video  at 14 46 when you are referring to above cell there might be a chance we can go array out of index if i 0  are you using 1 array for coins and 1 array for amount or you are using 2d array ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1475,6 59 why cannot you choose all choices   can you help explain that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1476, maidul13 because  you can only choose coins that are below the amount  eg  if you want to get amount 5  there is no point in choosing 10rs coin or coin greater than 5  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1477,for a larger sum this  need optimization specially for time complexity,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1479,madam i want to ask when the amount is 10 and the coin is 5 why is not 2 but 1  2 because i think we need 2 coin of 5 to become 10 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1480,sometimes your algorithm shows arrayoutofbound exception  so can you please show us the glimpse of whole code in the last of vedios so we can take the screenshot of the code,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1496,hi mam thanks for the video but there are a couple of things that i need to clarify the example that you have shown above does not have any repeated denominations and that is why i guess it worked perfectly when you take the below example where denominations are  4 10 25  and the total amount is 41 so the answer is  25 4 4 4 4 but when we apply the above procedure to this example i do not where we can get the repeated denominations please let me know if this method only works if the lowest denomination is 1 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1511,perfect explanation but one thing missed here if suppose we do not have 1 rs  coin means if i have coins   4  10  25  and amt  41 how to calculate this matrix there should always be one row with 0 coin which can have max infinity solns for each amount except 0 which would have 0 solns only  i think that is should include in this video just my advice   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1517,madam   your way of teaching concepts is as beautiful as you  excellent way of teaching  i was hoping more videos on dynamic programming and greedy algorithms  mostly shortest path algorithms and graph theory related algorithms,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1518,there are two cases of choosing two coins  first is  5 5  and another is  9 1  to make sum 10  right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1519,but  5 5  is optimal solution as it uses dynamic programming   whereas  if we use greedy technique   9 1  is correct answer ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1525, 25 00 it should be i<coin length  not i<  coin length,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1526,yes  thanks for the correction    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1527,what to do when no combination is  giving us any of the sum from 0 to 10  example if we take set  2 3 5  and we want to have a sum of 10  in this case how to make the table  when will be at j 3 we will fill 0 for i   2 and since it is zero  minimum  we have to copy it for i  3 but by using 1 coin of 3 we can have 3 as sum  so what to do  if any 0 comes we have to copy it to whole column under it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1576,sometimes when people first hear about the traveling salesman problem  they think   oh  that is not hard  start with a city on the map  move to the nearest unvisited city  and then on each subsequent step  move to the nearest still unvisited city  until you are done  this strategy is called a  greedy strategy  it always goes to the nearest allowed step ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1673,honestly  i do not think you are approaching this the right way at all  keep in mind simplicity and speed in my solutions   look another way  given vertices  we need to find the most  circular  shape  a circle is perfect solution to tsp   take a loop around your nodes  then contract it  until every node is connected  one way to do this   just take any two nodes  and connect them  back and forth  because we need to return  to form an initial loop  then keep adding nodes one by one whichever adds the least amount to a total distance for connecting it  this gives like just some 6 8  worse solution from expected perfect  for 1500 nodes  another way to do this is  instead of loss of distances  let us include points by their angle to the nearest line  take a loop around our nodes  join all the outside vertices  to make a convex polygon  then add any other vertex making a 180  because these are alreadty on our way anyway  and the closer the angle to 180  we give it priority to include  this produces just about 4  longer solution to anything we know for 1500 nodes  now combine the two  and the actual solution is probably to make a convex outside polygon to include all points in it is area  then find the centroid  then take the most distant points  include  then include all the  outside   outside of the new polygon after including the point  points  repeat  basically like putting pins  then using your fingers to get the thread around the pins towards the center  including every vertex on the way with least amount of tension possible  this way we use the least amount of thread possible ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1674,also to people who theorize multiple dimensions  we could probably just put every vertex in it is own  dimension  and then shrink it into 2d  should also do the job  edit  i am not good in math  ussr uni did not like me for not bringing sweets  d,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1774,hello madam according to the tree you represented there are few methods like g c  d  has been used twice to calculate the result in each recursive call  so can we just hold the first result and apply this during its second call to decrease time complexity or we are recalculating the methods over and over  and what approach is this whether top to down or bottom up approach,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1775,yes  exactly you should do it  as it saves computational cost with respect to recursive calls   that is the primary difference with recursive approach and dp ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1960,do we have to give a special condition where if w indicating the size of bag    w i the item weight  is a negative value  that means if the bag capacity is less than the size of the current item weight then we just need to put the above row values ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1961,i checked   w  or w o sorting the weights  end result is the same,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1967,well the answer is right because the valve of x is already arranged in question and we have to answer the question according to given valve,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1968, nishantshrivastava8937 yes   agree at the time of writing my message  i did not notice that jenny had intentionally sorted the weights   so i took table data as the truth and input as typo  later  i realized it is unnecessary to sort   whether we sort on weights or costs or do not sort   0 1 knapsack gives same result   as it is based on dynamic programming,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2005,thank you  i could recall the problem implementation with your explanation  small correction if you can consider is the formula given to fill the cells will not work for the cells in initial columns where that row s weight is less than that column s weight  try applying the formula to the cells where we have 0s filled  in that cases  we can copy the values from above rows which ofcourse you have covered in explanation  thank you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2119,tom is performing an experiment in which he has to select n products  each product has two attributes i e  energy and weight  all the products are either manufactured by reds ltd  or blues ltd  the products manufactured by blues ltd  cannot function alone and need to be selected with some other product of the same company  the products from reds ltd  on the other hand  can be selected independently  tom has to select products such that the total weight of the selected products does not exceed the weight w and the selected products have the maximum total energy value  write an algorithm to help tom find the maximum energy ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2322,  i also explained  this concept in easy method  pls go through and subscribe,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2323,shortuct  for  2 4  we simply write the profit of it i e 3 and we add 4 3 just simply add the one i e above to 4  and gives 7 and also add profit 2 3 it gives 5 so on the 7 th column we write 5 and for 5th and 6th columns we write 3 as it is and on 8th column we write whatever that is present in 7 this is used for all the things hope you found it easy ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2631,i often find in these types of talks that the speakers discuss simple concepts while glossing over the more complex parts  i am at the 1 40 to 2  18 part   talks about ratio and still yet to know what fractional means in this problem  4 15 begins the discussion of fractional finally framing the problem so i can begin to understand what she is discussing  its a problem to make videos without a real audience  if i was in the audience i would have asked what fractional meant right away ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2632,she sugar coats the topic for much wider audience and sometime you cannot just straightaway go for some higher concept   you need to lay a proper foundation first   i think you are a very poor coder if you think like this   sorry mate ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2762,explanation is good but this is not a right way to teach dp  first we need to understand the recursive logic and when the recursive logic is developed then only we can made a dp solution  video like this did not include basics of dp and no can solve questions of dp directly by making a table  if you do not know which problem is overlapping then how you can do so ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2782,your algorithm videos have helped me alot  i am grateful to you  if you have time  could you make some videos of backtracking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2783,firstly   i liked her topological sort video  she did a good job  but really disappointed at this  this is exactly how everyone taught dp in my university and this is exactly not how dp problems can be understood  this is why in exams i could do dp problems but could not solve unknown problems in interviews  she should explain why she is doing what she is doing  it is all about that inuition   for example  in this case  dp i j  shows whether you can make up sum j using array elemnets 0 to i  this is a clear 0 1 knapsack pattern of dp problem  the equation is  dp i j    true  if  i 0 and j a i    j> a i  dp i 1 j a i true  how do you get to this equztion  that is what the explanation should focus on  but basically if you understand knapsack  you will get it  you can also draw a state diagram to get to this intuition  why does most of the videos say stuff like   we just copy the values from upper row  without explaining why you do that  dp problems is all about finding the recurrence relation from to move from one state to another  and most of these videos conveniently skip it  the coding part is super trivial once you have the equation    but please please do not mug it without understanding like how she tells do this then do that  understand why you need to do it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2896,after 20 58 your sequence is going wrong  you have changes the direction in the last row column to upward side  now you have to change the direction of others      to    to the upward direction to find lcs efficiently  after changing last  4  direction to upward your   lcs would be abab   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2897,at first i thought it would be a boring lecture  because of no intro and lack of grammar  but as i continued to watch  i realised that her words were on point and straight forward   explanation was no more and no less than required  if she would have said the formula earlier then i would have stopped watching because i am scared of math  sometimes complex problem can be explained by just simple words and gestures which is all it takes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2938,total subsequence is equal to 2 n  as no  of subset of a set is 2 n  which also contains empty set   hence i guess here also one string is going to be empty  bcd        b   c     d   because   cd   bd    bcd    now 2 n  2 3  8,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2961,implemented a dp algo that can generate longest common subsequence s  from multiple input strings o n s s  time to build dp data o n   2 s  time to get longest common subsequence this is in worst case in real time  this would be very fast  because as we move from dp data of 1 string to the next  the data to compare exponentially decreases   coz we are looking for common  i e  intersection  subsequence  but not union,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3150,i think you should explain the intuition behind the two formulae   when x i y j  then c i j    1  c i 1 j 1  we take the length of lcs  without including the matching character from both the strings  and then add 1 to it  to include the matching character  when x i y j  then c i j    max c i 1 j    c i j 1  we consider the length of lcs excluding x i  and the length of lcs excluding y j  and then take the max of the two ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3224,nice explanation  but how the problem is solved using this matrix  means how can we think that it can be solved creating such matrix ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3225,surprisingly nobody asked this question and everyone simply accepted the formula  none of the youtube videos explains why a matrix is used for this problem   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3226,in the matrix  a i j  represents the value of max common subsequence when we take the first i characters of string a and j characters of string b  we start from 1st char of string a and b  now from these value we derive what if one more character is added to either of the strings ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
