18,very thoughtful and objective review   i happened to just mention the model 3 to my wife after watching your review   she currently drives a camry hybrid and she is very happy with it   i drive it more now since i retired earlier this year   retiring meant the company no longer pays the gas for my dodge ram hemi pick up   since the beginning of covid i have put on only 300 miles in almost two years   the one time i filled it up it cost me  100  notwithstanding the cost of fuel  i have always disliked contributing to air pollution besides   i love the truck  especially after upgrading the suspension and it has served me well for hauling stuff and making runs to the motorcycle race track  but the majority of my driving is around town so the logical option is upgrading to an all electric car    reviews like yours make you tube a valuable resource  my one gripe is the behavior of elon musk  he is going off his rocker as he gets richer  more about himself than ever ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

389,true but no true  that is also something that also happens in big cnc machines  were i worked some years ago were the activation of some functions of the machines were done by changing 8 bit parameters in hidden menus  the customer could do it by himself  but he will lose the support and parts from the company who sold the machine  having to rely in used parts or other service providers  with tesla is the same  the car keeps receiving on air updates  and i am sure they check if the functions of the car are the same as the ones saved in the database on tesla hq  if something is different and there is not any proof of service regarding that the warranty must be void  so in reality yes you can do it  but you will probably need to rely in other providers for support when you have problems with your car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

426,the  35 000 model 3 is actually shipping now and the base model comes with 220 miles of charge range which is a better value than an upgraded nissan leaf with it is longer rang battery   now that the 35 00 model 3 is actually shipping  i think it would be adequate as is  without the  3 000 auto driving system added ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

537,i own a toyota prius prime has the speed sensor in traffic heated seats  plug in and gas  no range anxiety here   35k is still too high   i paid 27k for mine at the base model  i do not see tesla putting these in used car parking lots  they have ultimate control of your car  similar to iphone ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

555,only flaw with your videos is that they are not 60fps  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
556,60fps feels unnatural for actual camera footage  the most natural  cinematic movie experience is around 24 fps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
557, aichnerchristian since when stuttery camera movement is realistic ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
558, glitchysoup6322 on games 60fps might be awesome   once it is crisp and there is virtually no motion blur  in reality  that motion blur is what makes it feel natural  sure  shutterspeed plays a huge role as well  film with 24fps and a > 1 120 shutter instead of 1 48 and you will have your crispy image ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
559, aichnerchristian says you  60 fps feels  more smooth and natural than 24fps to me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
560, aichnerchristian that is called the soap opera effect  and the reason people say  it feels more natural  is because we are so used to seeing it  even though 60 fps would be more natural since our eyes can see much above the frame rate of 60 fps   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
561,i am guessing that youtube caps the bitrate  so 30 fps is significantly sharper  although not as smooth  as 60 fps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

638, kii6063 exactly  and does he she think that we need to impede the progress on fast and efficient transportation in order to save racing  i love formula 1 and other vehicular races and touring events  but god will i be such a pain in the ass if i insist that all cars have to stay the same and not progress just because  i want to enjoy racing  within our lifetimes we will not see the whole world change to electric anyways  and we definitely will still see human controlled racing   he she also point out that now people can say they drive a car because they can use the car  and that does not make sense  well it does  but it is a stupid statement to make  is learning how to drive a car such a valuable personality trait that someone being able to be in a car and use it to transport themselves without having to learn such things is something that invalidates their own process of learning how to drive  it does not invalidate that  but either way  that is like arguing computers are bad because human calculation took more effort and people who calculated really skillfully would be invalidated by computers  we still got and decided to start installing computers because they are going to be better  and advance us into a new stage  sure  those people who used to be really good quick mathematicians  skills would not be needed  but computers have freed up so much more than even those mathematicians can comprehend  if i could produce 100 of those mathematicians in 1 computer for an overall lesser wage over the years it will work compared to one of those mathematicians  then of course i will pick the computer  if there were only 40 out of 100 people who decided to buy a car and get around and 60 100 did not just because of the learning barrier and safety barrier  then with cars that do not have a steep learning curve may see that to 90 out of 100 people  i am not saying more people should buy cars  i am saying that now more people have access to cars  and that is not the only thing that any technological advancement can free up from the older or previous generations ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

831,for an almost 60k car that is disappointing   you can get autopark with cars costing 20 30k  when you hit 60k that is premium territory  model 3 is not premium and interior is beyond disappointing  obviously the self drive features are a plus  but i just cannot see why anyone would buy it  i get if it was under 45k for the top spec version  not 57 5k   uk base price is 35k  i am assuming the version mkbhd drives would also be  57 5k   audi a7 sportback starting price is  55k   i am a big fan of tesla  35k is certainly affordable but there is still a long way to go  if i could afford one  i would go for the model s  my favourite car without a doubt  model x is also up there with my favs  model 3 is just not appealing in any way  shape or form ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1074,if the milage range based on your driving style it s not right that battery increased for from 233 to 233 miles  because even in gasoline car when range shows in city 100miles and when you start driving on freeway or downhills the range increases because of your last minutes driving  range bases on usually your last 5 15 minuets driving  actual increase you can see from battery percentage ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1107,overtimed what s wrong about having a tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1108,fresh dasani it s a very watered down car  even though it s quicker than most super cars to 0 60  it takes away most of the fun that internal combustion engines can bring  fun things like rev matching and heel toe down shifting  sound is a big factor and electric cars have none  nothing is inherently wrong about owning a tesla  my uncle does  but for a car enthusiast it s a poor way of spending money  instant torque may be fun but there s no passion in the driving experience  it also takes away modifications as modify tesla s internally can turn south quickly  handling isn t the best either  as body roll and vague steering are the biggest problems with tesla s  engineering is another thing that s different between the two  and not to say tesla s aren t amazing in design and innovation  they are  but the electric powertrain will always be technically superior to internal combustion engines making engineering less impressive  and no snails either on tesla s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1109,overtimed  no passion  for you  in the driving experience ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1110, natearellano4919 but bro not everybody thinks that way  what you are saying are words of an enthusiastic person  not everybody is like that  some people want convenience  tesla brings that convienience  no engine breakdown  no fluid changes and no hassle  just tyre replacements and charging battery ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1111,prabhat goyal that s not true  a tesla uses its own proprietary fluids to cool and manage the battery and electric motors  which will have to be replaced down the line  another problem is that nobody can sell parts for a tesla since they are proprietary  which means your forced to bring it directly to tesla with a normal but expensive markup  in fact  a tesla may be more hassle than a normal car because the charging stations are far more sparse than regular gas or petrol stations  even a non enthusiast can appreciate a reliable and robust car  but tesla s are still patchy in terms of reliability even though they are getting better  another problem is that you can t use universal parts on a tesla  since everything is patented and proprietary  if you need to replace a battery module in toyota prius you are looking at several thousand dollars  but that s a prius  which has universal parts since the patent expired  it s true that tesla will most likely fix these issues in the future but we don t know how soon  tesla s may have an electric pt but they still require hydraulic fluid for the brakes and coolant for the radiators  the tesla used industry standard disc brakes with that comes replacing pads and rotors  another problem is that tesla s depreciate like a heavy rock  you can pick up a 2016 anything for almost 10 or 15 thousand below the msrp  the internal combustion car has been refined and honed for almost 120 years as opposed to electric cars which have only popped up in the last 20 years  lastly  most of the time it takes a decent chunk of time to charge a tesla  not sure how much  but that s a bit inconvenient and is  the nature of electric powered anything  much less a full blown car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1117,i have a model 3 long range all wheel drive and it is by far the best vehicle i have ever driven  it is several levels of magnitude better than any other car i have ever been in  it has exceeded my expectations and even surprised me on several fronts  for example i had a false belief that it might be inconvenient to charge a  car instead of stopping and getting gas at a  convenience  store  it is the opposite  it is so easy  saves me time  keeps me from spilling stinking  toxic gasoline on my clothes and hands and i am taking money away from an industry that is pushing it is costs off on the health care industry  i installed a solar array before i purchased the car and also installed a 240 volt outlet  it is so much easier and literally takes 5 seconds for 98 percent of my charges  the super charging network is also very good and the v3 super charger is going to once again change everything forever ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1143,a car that is more affordable and is actually mass produced without burning cash is not a step down  tesla is quickly running out of money to burn and you will not get any model anymore  even this version is heavily subsidized  the i8 is not  hence the i8 is a huge step up   because it actually economically works and does not depend on investors credit ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1146,going to to be funny when tesla still cannot make a profit after finally catching up because the market right now is weighing heavily in the favor of crossovers and suvs  and not 120k ones that look more like an ugly lifted sportback  model s will always be the best and tesla keeps digging themselves a deeper whole every vehicle they have introduced after that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1147,very well produced,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1148,it s still way too expensive  for most people if you have 35 to 60 thousand dollars you can get some pretty incredible petrol cars  i mean you can get a top of the line mustang for that price  no disrespect  i m a huge fan of tesla s  especially the model s  i just think that the value for this car isn t great ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1245,loved it    i think auto focus is the best step that you have taken  it is really good   keep it up mkbhd   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1246,compare it to a similarily priced car like maybe a 3 series bmw with a hybrid engine ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1247,intro is dope,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1248,so this model3 for  57k or i can buy a fully loaded hyundai ioniq  with hyundai version of autopliot which is lvl2 same as tesla  for around the base price of the model3  35k  here is a thought maybe compare this car to the hyundai ioniq  i am going to be real with you  to me this vid feels like a 12min ad for tesla so i really hope tesla paid you for it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1249,i can t even remember to charge my phone sometimes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1250,luis maciel do you forget to fill your car with gas too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1251,yes  sometimes i do  but there is not problem with that because there is a gas station en every block,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1253,francis hubert  240 is not always necessary  especially when plugging in at the end of the day  your life will have a slight change as an ev owner  but it only takes adjusting  it s definitely not a step backward  i own a tesla and purchasing has been the best decision ever for me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1254, francis hubert the car itself sets a program on when to charge it on a big trip ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1255,francis hubert but your car will remind you to charge it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1259,test murcielago sv  p jus kiddin,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1260,nissan leaf 2  it is a pretty convincing package as it is now  design is way better than the first one  i like it a lot  with a performance and battery upgrade to 60kwh and maybe even a nismo version to come later this year it is the most serious competitor to the model 3 in my opinion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1261,this was so well done marques  in awe of your talent ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1262,of course  he had to choose the red one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1263,that front end is hideous,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
1264,only thing i do not get is how auto pilot is a 5000 premium when it can be added with a software patch  it is like day 1 dlc  that is kind of dumb  car looks great though  really made me want one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1265,theantimetal yeah  programing such a program does not take any money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1266,i would honestly rather them charge 3000 extra on the base and recoup the price that way  having it as a feature that is basically paywalled off kind of sucks  i understand there is definitely tons of time spent on the program by the dev team  and the fact that it exists is super impressive  i just do not like that i would be paying for a car that has the capability it just is basically turned off  but that is just my opinion man lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1267,i guess they realize is better to make all cars with the hardware so more people can add  buy  the software in the future  actually i prefer like that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1268,wait wait wait  so autopilot is an on disk paid dlc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1269,let me try to explain  it costs tesla huge amounts of money to develop the autopilot and camera system  the actual hardware itself is not what you pay for  they are making the model 3 in the most efficient way  so they can produce as many as they can in as little time possible  and i am pretty sure they found out that adding the camera s whether you  paid for them  or not is more efficient  plus it makes it a lot easier for people that did not want it when they originally bought the car to upgrade later  because it is just software  you do not need to take half the car apart ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1270,no more than any downloadable title for pc ios switch etc  is on disk paid dlc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1271,the enhanced autopilot includes more sensors and cameras,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1276,mathieu macadam yea  but those are a prerequisite for the enhanced autopilot anyway right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1277,king d yeah  it was a good joke too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1278,is not a dlc  and it does not installs via a disc  it is an option that you can choose while ordering the car but if you do not choose it you still can enable it trough an over the air update or ota ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1279,yes  but what does it cost if you upgrade later  are you punished with a huge price tag for doing it that way ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1280,it is  however  the hardware that make it possible is the same hardware for autonomous driving p i cannot wait to get some money and buy one for my self ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1283, michaelozimmermannjcdecs it costs  7000 to upgrade after owning the car  but during order if you purchase it  it is only  5000  hope this helps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1284,no model 3 is worth over  40 000  idc what  options  it has ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1285,does that mean i could copy a software form another model 3 with autopilot and install it on a model 3 with no auto pooley  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1286,mathieu macadam no it does not  it is literally just more software ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1287, paintballthieupwns those cameras and sensors are on every model 3  with or without the option  the 5k is a software purchase,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1291, joseb lu6bi woooosh,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1292, theescalatorspanky but the problem is that you pay extra for beta testing the  future  of self driving  we do not know when it will be 100  capable and by the time it is  you have probably bought a new car  thus making it not worth it  not only does the value of the car decrease over time  but you also lose the purpose and money of enhanced autopilot  that being said i cannot see into the future  so i might be wrong  but that is just my current opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1377,wait  they want  5 000 for autopilot and it is just a software update  wtf ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1378,let me try to explain  it costs tesla huge amounts of money to develop the autopilot and camera system  the actual hardware itself is not what you pay for  they are making the model 3 in the most efficient way  so they can produce as many as they can in as little time possible  and i am pretty sure they found out that adding the camera s whether you  paid for them  or not is more efficient  plus it makes it a lot easier for people that did not want it when they originally bought the car to upgrade later  because it is just software  you do not need to take half the car apart  so what you are paying for is the development of the autopilot  you say    that costs them literally nothing to supply to you  but that is just fundamentally wrong  it does cost something  and you are still getting value for your extra spend  the other cars that have options that you pay for to get added could just add it to all the cars too  but they choose not to  or they do even but nobody knows as they are not as popular  who knows  but getting angry at tesla because they already put the hardware in but you cannot use it because you did not pay for it is weird  if they would not have added it your experience would have been exactly the same  and then if you pay for it you can use it  except that now you do not have to get hardware installed like with the other cars models you mention  i understand that it feels weird at first  but when you think more about it  it is probably the most efficient choice for tesla  thus keeping overall costs down  so they are able to provide cars at current price levels   it is a bit like saying top tier smartphones should be way cheaper because the hardware does not cost as much as the price you pay as consumer  but that makes perfect sense considering all the other factors like research and marketing that are involved   also i thought i read somewhere that they also all come with the big battery inside  model 3 and model s  and that it is just software controlled how much you can use  depending on which model you bought  again  efficiency  do we make loads of different battery sizes or just 1 for all cars  do you see tesla s way of thinking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1468,five thousand dollars for a software update to enable cameras and equipment needed for autopilot even though all the kit is there even on the base model is totally ridiculous  i mean its all there you are literally paying for it to be activated which basically means its cheaper for tesla to build them all with the equipment included than to make some without because the parts are cheap for them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1469,i k now the video  crispiness  is really important  but you could have used some kind of stabilized camera  even from the 2017 flagship phones  instead of having some crispy but shaky shots  but i have seen the ig live for a minute and i k now you are already takin care of things  great video  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1489,hi marques  tesla is currently unprofitable  always has been  they do not make money on their  100k cars and they certianly will not make money on their  35k  cars  i use   because the model 3 will most likely be around  60k when you add on features   would you like to discuss comments from people like jim chanos and the general market view that tesla is going to need to raise a lot more capital  or potentially go broke  what would tesla folding mean for customers who buy the cars  what would it mean for tesla fanboys  thanks,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1522,damn my dude  i do not understand how your video always comes out the best ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1523,i am suffering from a severe case of in car screen envy right now  > <   seriously though  it may be a bit too soon to tell  but the model 3 certainly seems like a phenomenal deal at  35    40k ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1524,so you could just jailbreak it to unlock the 5k extra  i would love to see the real performance of it like you should have given it the beans up in the canyan,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1525,is there a lot of charging areas in nyc  interested in purchasing,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1526,it is sad to see that here in brazil a three cilinder  1 0 liter car  costs arround r 40 50k and in usa for us 40k you cand get a tesla  fully electric  with auto pilot  sometimes i wish move to usa ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1527,are you comparing dollars to reals  or did you convert reals to dollars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1528,igor henrique yea it suck man to hear that mexico is one of the most expensive cars sales in the world but be lucky you re not living in singapore,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
1529,i am doing a comparison between dollars and reals  because if you are living and working in usa you will earn in dollars and if you works in brazil  you will receive your salary in reals  it is obviously that there is an exchange difference between these two currencies  but that is the point  here in brazil  we work the same than people in usa  but we can purchase much less  not everything here sucks  but our governement put tons of fees in everything  it is really sad ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1530,i know that our country is not the worse country of the world  but  you know  things could be better to us ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1531,as of today  brazilian real equals 0 31 us dollar  so the car marques tested would cost about 170 000 brazilian real   before taxes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1532,what people in the us do not realize is that say you make  700 usd in a week  but people in other countries also make 700 a week in their currency  however  prices are usually the in usd or eur so converting that  and then applying the import tarrifs on products shit gets real expensive real quick ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1533,jrs97t   here in brazil  a tesla model s 75d costs around r 750k  so  do you think it is fair ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1534,xphenom the high amount of taxes is the point  here  we have to pay  3 5 times more for the same product  comparing to other countries  it is really sad ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1535,igor henrique you re right  i had no idea brazil s import tax on cars made them cost 3x as much   that is insane protectionism   i m opposed to all import and export taxes because they only serve to support local products that otherwise wouldn t sell   your country s tax is making its own citizens poorer by forcing them to overpay for things that shouldn t cost them so much ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1536,haha that is nothing  come to south africa  and then rethink what you said ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1537,brazil s streets are probably too crowded for a car anyway  i heard in most cities you cannot even surpass 30 mph becuase of the traffic ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1538,never said that  do not twist my words  crowded streets do not mean it is a shithole  newyork is not a shit hole  but a car might not be a good idea there either ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
1539,but we do not need to compare gpd  ppp  per capita  because in south america  we have countries with worse gpd than brazil  but with less fees in products  as an example  paraguay is 107th in the gpd rank  according to the international bank  and brazil places the 81th position  but people here in brazil constantly goes to paraguay in order to buy eletrocnics  clothes  tires  etc  our government put taxes in everything  lots of it  this is the because our insatisfaction ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1540,tallyn maher really  i know that there are places with higher taxes than brazil  but i do not think it is fair ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1541,traffic cone bro  maybe in s o paulo there are some avenues crowded of cars  but at least where i live  belo horizonte  the traffic is not perfect  but you can perfectly drive everyday  to everywhere if you want  i have a car and a motorcycle  for me it is better to go to work and to college by motorcycle  because it is cheaper  comparated to car  and faster too  by the way  believe or not  in the big cities here in brazil things are not too bad  it is even good  comparated to huge capitals like ny ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1542,i must have been misinformed  i have only been to brazil once  and my stay was very traffic dense  and it was literally faster to rent a bike than a car because of how congested the roads were  i actually stayed in salvador ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1543,hakan  that kind of stuff happens only in some very fucked up neighborhoods in big cities like rio  s o paulo and salvador  you should remember that brasil is a huge country  germany is smaller than most of brazilian states  and there are  for sure  lots of problems but it s not everywhere ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1544,before comparing currencies think about life cost in every country ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1548,igor henrique you need to stop complaining  if you don t like brazil  then come move to the usa  it is not that hard  some people i know want to move to brazil from the us  stop complaining and make the best of your situation,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1612,it would cost more money to get tesla s to such places so the price would be higher and the people there would have less money  not a good mix of conditions  plus there is more demand locally than they can currently deal with  so all in due time ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1613,different people   different politics also blame thank your ancestors for having what you have  the richer you are the easier it is to get more money and the other way around the less you have the harder it is to acquire more wealth  they say the first million is the hardest  because that first million helps get the second and so on and so forth ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1671,my bmw 428i i had on a lease  with some options including the tech package  was up around  53k  if i did not have it on a lease i would have never paid that much  but i must say the car was extremely fun to drive  i had the option of getting the 435i but i actually liked the 428i better as it just felt better   it was slower  but it cornered better and did not feel as nose heavy  so my mostly tricked out 428i  would i rather have that or have this  well there is no way that this is as fun to drive   the bmw is the best handling car i have ever owned  one of my previous car was a c6 corvette  while the bmw had the tech package  the amount of tech in the bmw really is not all that impressive  i loved the full color hud with gps built in  it was fantastic since you would get on windshield directions  what lane to be in  etc  all with never looking down   but outside of that it was mostly basic stuff and it lacked many of the features that my fully loaded cts had  like dvd audio and air conditioned seats  the model 3 is not a very good looking car  but it is not horrendous  but the 428i certainly looks better  also while the bmw has a fairly bland looking interior  once you actually sit behind the wheel you realize how good it is as everything is laid out fantastically   the tesla interior however looks extremely gimmicky   as for the battery issue  whatever  i do not care if it is gas or electric  but i do like the idea of roller coaster like acceleration  the 428i has a twin turbo 4 cyclinder  and when the bmw dealer told me it was only a 4 under the hood i nearly spit in his face for insulting me by even asking me to drive it  but honestly it is a great engine  the car has a low 5s 0 60 and as mentioned earlier the car handles great because it is not too heavy   the 6cyl 435i is very nose heavy and driving the two back to back  you can tell the bmw was built around the 4 which has perfect 50 50 balance  the tesla meanwhile is not going to be handling monster  it is just too heavy   so what would i do  having never driven a tesla  well i would buy it over the 428i for a few basic reasons  the amount of tech in the tesla is just amazing   but mainly the auto pilot  that is a huge selling point to me  i love driving on empty roads  but the option of letting the car take car of the driving in traffic is fantastic and it will only get better  the 428i i had has no ability to ever do that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1672,rod munch bmw owners have said the model 3 handles just as good an even better than the 3 series  a prossesional driver likened the balance to an e46 m3   model 3 weighs 3500 to 3800 lbs and has very precise steering  and no driver display means you can move the steering wheel into a more comfortable position  while having a clearer view of the road ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1673,azalru i find that impossible to believe  my 428i has the sport package but it seemed to mostly be some cosmetic stuff  not the m sport package which is different  the 428i is amazingly well balanced and precise   you can push the car to its limits and it s still completely controllable   it s just amazing how well it sticks to the ground and does exactly what you want  i just don t see how the tesla 3 can match that   but if it did then it s a no brainer  i look foreword to test driving one once they ramp up production more and have some places where you can drive them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1683,that starting price is totally misleading  you have to option it with the extended range option  9 000  and autopilot  5 000  which turns your car into  a not so affordable 49 000  car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1684,i do not think its misleading   all cars have a base price and it increases with options    the extended range is an option and you do not have to get it but have to wait for the regular one to be available   no one forces you to upgrade    you also do not have to upgrade paint  tires  and interior  or get a premium option   those are all personal choices    you also do not have to pay the  5k for auto pilot if you do not want   its no different then paying for those type of advanced features in all cars the  35k gets you an awesome all electric car that can go 0 60 in 4 6 seconds  so i do not think its misleading at all ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1707,vincent levinger i did my research  none of them have the hands free approach that tesla has on autopark ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1709,i am sorry to break it to the people who have repplied to your comment  all those brands have autopilot with a diffrent name  and autopark  check out audis traffic jam assist  mercedes distronic plus,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1710,erfan m those are driver assist and require alot more handholding compared to the real deal from tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1711,why am i reading this even though i cannot buy any cars mentioned here,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1712,azalru of course its assistance so is teslas  mercedes distronic plus has all the same features as tesla  changing lanes  parking automaticly  keeping in the lane  teslas technology is great but othere automakers provide similar technologies  ill admit tesla was the first to provide these technologies but in the current market place similar features are provided by its compiteters  this shows how competitive the auto industry is,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1714,nixxxon18 please cry more lmao,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1715,those other manufactures mentioned  auto park is not standard options like in model 3  we have latest bmw and benz and it s an option that cost   but not that bad 500 2500  but they are conservative and requires drivers input   with tesla it s one button hit and rest is done for you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1841,not a big fan of the lack of physical buttons knobs  the central screen   for example  the vent control on screen looks  gimmicky  and more complicated to use than standard knobs that require no minimal attention to use  that is why physical decated buttons are there  minimal attention is used to use them so you can focus on driving  i feel like tesla is complicating stuff buy putting them all on the central screen  in different menus  i feel like it is less  safe maybe it is countered with the autopilot   for the central screen  it feels so misplaced  added after the fact  i am not big on design  i am more a function vs form guy  but having this big screen right there and not being part of the dash design does not work for me  plus  i do not know if your speed info can disappear if your  passanger is messing around in the menus  gps  etc  i like the tacometer behind the wheel more  it is integrated in the dash s design  easier to see same spot in 99 9  of cars  other than that  the car looks awesome  seems to have good performance which i like  p  i am really looking into ev for my future car  hope the see the awd version soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1875,1  teslas giga factory is not even finished yet  will it ever be finished  the batteries and assembly equipment belong to panasonic who also have staff there   2  model 3 productions is so bad that they have to resort to hand assembly when making them  why do you think mkbhd called it a unicorn  they cannot even make the damn things  that is why they are so rare at the moment   3  auto pilot is level 2  basically adaptive cruise control with lane keep assist  which european manufacturers have had for years  audi have their level 3 system on the market and it literally drives itself in traffic  changes lanes without the need for the driver to interact  teslas system is soo far behind the competition  its not even worth mentioning 4  lexus have had self parking cars for over a decade   5  tesla have no battery ip  its all panasonic  toyota have better tech on the way  more energy dense batteries  6  tesla is a car company that cannot build cars that also owns a loss making solar company   7  tesla is burning so much money it will eventually go bust unless it raises more money  8  i can guarantee you the truck and new roadster are vapourware ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1876, paranoidandroid87 i chose tesla as a research company for my undergrad research in finance  i have noticed they changed their mission statement to being a renewable energy company  instead of a car manufacturer  in addition  they have released their  car  patents to other companies so that they could adopt the same technology  this is a smart business model  since tesla has been entirely focused on building the biggest electric car battery factory in the world and have created sufficient demand by showing other automobile manufacturers that electric cars can be a profitable business  as well as get all the tax breaks and funding  in the form of aid  from the government  according to rules and regulations that preceded the trump administration  what i concluded at the end was that  although tesla  the company  is providing valuable  ethically sound and profitable business model  they lacked the financial structure necessary for me to comfortably invest money in their stock  at the time   this is not financial advice of any kind  i do not have any fiduciary duty towards any online readers  this is merely my opinion on a company i chose as my case study during my college career  if you choose to act on the information provided in my comment  do so at your own risk  to answer your questions  tesla  the car manufacturer will probably not be around but they will supply the  presumably  growing demand in electric car batteries to other car manufacturers as a renewable energy company ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1919,azalru you also don t buy something that has hardware on it that is locked behind a pay wall  if they can sell you the hardware at a profit and all it needs is a software unlock then as the customer you are paying hundreds or thousands extra for a software key that costs them literally nothing to supply to you  unlike a games console  tesla makes a profit even when they sell you the base version  that s a tough pill to swallow  most cars have optional or enhanced features added to them at the factory in a modular design like parking sensors and all around cameras  at least then you can feel you re getting value for your extra spend because the devices aren t present on lower tier models  tesla s approach seems stingy and poor value in comparison ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1920,stephen wakeman it is not an unlock  you literally need to install software much like a purchased program ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1921,let me try to explain  it costs tesla huge amounts of money to develop the autopilot and camera system  the actual hardware itself is not what you pay for  they are making the model 3 in the most efficient way  so they can produce as many as they can in as little time possible  and i am pretty sure they found out that adding the camera s whether you  paid for them  or not is more efficient  plus it makes it a lot easier for people that did not want it when they originally bought the car to upgrade later  because it is just software  you do not need to take half the car apart  so what you are paying for is the development of the autopilot  you say    that costs them literally nothing to supply to you  but that is just fundamentally wrong  it does cost something  and you are still getting value for your extra spend  the other cars that have options that you pay for to get added could just add it to all the cars too  but they choose not to  or they do even but nobody knows as they are not as popular  who knows  but getting angry at tesla because they already put the hardware in but you cannot use it because you did not pay for it is weird  if they would not have added it your experience would have been exactly the same  and then if you pay for it you can use it  except that now you do not have to get hardware installed like with the other cars models you mention  i understand that it feels weird at first  but when you think more about it  it is probably the most efficient choice for tesla  thus keeping overall costs down  so they are able to provide cars at current price levels   it is a bit like saying top tier smartphones should be way cheaper because the hardware does not cost as much as the price you pay as consumer  but that makes perfect sense considering all the other factors like research and marketing that are involved   also i thought i read somewhere that they also all come with the big battery inside  model 3 and model s  and that it is just software controlled how much you can use  depending on which model you bought  again  efficiency  do we make loads of different battery sizes or just 1 for all cars  do you see tesla s way of thinking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1922,you are paying for the development you moron  this is a common business practice  it is cheaper to just mass produce the same product and lock and unlock the variations ,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
1923,the special about the car is the price  the lowest they got is 40k so they told themselves  hey  let us remove the autopilot feature from the base cost so it goes even lower and let people have the cheapest car we can make and let them decide what to add to the cost ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1924,stephen wakeman a hackers dream,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1925,i disagree with you  this is nothing new  owning a 2014 bmw f30  i found out that my car had a lot of features with the hardware already in place but software locked   most people like me simply unlock these features using esys  bmw coding  and similar software  tesla is not  reinventing the wheel  plus like every other car company  they need to make a profit ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1927,martinuusss your smartphone analogy is flawed  tesla s model would be like you buying a galaxy s8 for  800 and getting exactly the same phone as me when i buy the cheaper version that forces itself to run at a lower screen resolution and underclocks its cpu to reduce its performance  knowing that everything is there but cannot be used  to me  elicits a very unsatisfactory feeling  the development cost of the parking software is pretty much static  once that software has been developed that s it  they ll refine it  sure  but the amount you pay is extortionate  self parking on other brands costs less and yet you get the software for that as well and their manufacturing model is not as cost effective as tesla s  to me that is not good value and that is compounded by the fact that it s just software hack away from being available to you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1983,this can be a very dope series  but you might have to she will out a lil bit more for production  this feels very rushed and unfinished  the shot composition was bad for the car interview parts  that low angle was hella unflattering  the best scenes were towards the end with the sexy shots of the car b  roll  i am not trash talking  it is just that this video does not match the quality of your other tech videos ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

1995,the sapien hardware and safety features  you have to install a very long software update which is not unlocking it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1996,let me try to explain  it costs tesla huge amounts of money to develop the autopilot and camera system  the actual hardware itself is not what you pay for  they are making the model 3 in the most efficient way  so they can produce as many as they can in as little time possible  and i am pretty sure they found out that adding the camera s whether you  paid for them  or not is more efficient  plus it makes it a lot easier for people that did not want it when they originally bought the car to upgrade later  because it is just software  you do not need to take half the car apart  so what you are paying for is the development of the autopilot  you say    that costs them literally nothing to supply to you  but that is just fundamentally wrong  it does cost something  and you are still getting value for your extra spend  the other cars that have options that you pay for to get added could just add it to all the cars too  but they choose not to  or they do even but nobody knows as they are not as popular  who knows  but getting angry at tesla because they already put the hardware in but you cannot use it because you did not pay for it is weird  if they would not have added it your experience would have been exactly the same  and then if you pay for it you can use it  except that now you do not have to get hardware installed like with the other cars models you mention  i understand that it feels weird at first  but when you think more about it  it is probably the most efficient choice for tesla  thus keeping overall costs down  so they are able to provide cars at current price levels   it is a bit like saying top tier smartphones should be way cheaper because the hardware does not cost as much as the price you pay as consumer  but that makes perfect sense considering all the other factors like research and marketing that are involved   also i thought i read somewhere that they also all come with the big battery inside  model 3 and model s  and that it is just software controlled how much you can use  depending on which model you bought  again  efficiency  do we make loads of different battery sizes or just 1 for all cars  do you see tesla s way of thinking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
1997,the escalator  yeah  i kind of already assumed all of that  but that is all tesla s side and internal  i am talking about buyer s perception  which is really what this channel normally is all about  and it matters  the base price is a sad state of not being in the club  while taunting you to join with constant reminders all around your car  this is lame for anyone who does not upgrade  a better company would just have the base price include this tesla feature instead of trying to market their cars as  5 000 cheaper  maybe someone could then ask for  discounted  model without telsa s signature stuff and be lame if they really wanted  as if any would ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2057,azalru could you maybe just watch a video of a model 3 when it parks  you need to press the gas brake pedal  which is exactly the same as in a golf  since you probably never did that yourself and will not accept anything anyone tells you  it is kind of a waste of time to talk to you  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2058,ismo mattila everyone can search on youtube and see how annoying the menu selection setup  beeping  shifting gears  braking and gas pedaling the toyota is  does not even put itself in park either  way far from tesla hands free autopark ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2060,yeah i thoughed the same  also the interior looks so poor compared to cars that cost half the price  like the vw golf  opel astra  peugeot  volvo  bmw  mercedes  etc etc maybe this is more common in europe compared to the us  but i would geuss it is not ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2063,stefan sch fer well he s not a car guy  and he doesn t even know that much more about cars other than his own tesla  he got a few things wrong about cars in general  like what you mentioned  also air suspension  it s one of things  what he mentioned as a good thing a lot of people don t even like coz it takes away a lot of the feel so many people like  then also that roof  why pay more to have the worst roof  specially in places like california  i bet you can bake and cook inside that car during the summer ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2071,singularity is unstoppable a  always a good idea to put people boxes and generalise  best way to go   if you would know how many german pro tesla channels there are  you would maybe rethink your statement  but hey  who cares about facts   aaaand that is how we close the circle  if you want to put germans in a box  we are pretty critical about stuff and do not just settle with the coolest solution  which has it is downsides but turned out to be quite a good thing in terms of quality and prestige ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2072,singularity is unstoppable a  sorry to read about all the pain you feel  maybe try to get out of your  everyone is evil and that is the reason for all of my problems hole  and start to own your life   obviously the german industry is a huge part of the countries income and is therefore protected within legal borders  that will only buy them some time to adjust to the new conditions  five years from now the big car makers will have adjusted themselves and ev will take over  that is what every country on earth does with their respective specialised fields of industry finance or whatever ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2154,the bmw i3 starts at  44 450 and only has 114 miles range on battery  the model 3 gets 310 miles at  35 000  base price     9 000  range extender     44 000 so it cannot be that bad  but then again i know nothing about cars      ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2167,the only reason i would want a tesla would be for the autopilot feature  i do not really care about the rest of the stuff  but that autopilot for freeway stop and go traffic looks totally kickass  also for parking  to be able to summon your car to the door would be some next level shit  and hell to the no i would not spend another  9 000 to go an extra 90 miles per charge  220 mile range is plenty for me and millions of others out there who drive 100 miles or less in a day  most people live within a few miles of work and drive way less than that  to be honest this model 3 is a little ugly i am going to  i think they did not want it to be too attractive so it does not woo any model s buyers to the cheaper little brother   let us just work on getting this autopilot shit on all new cars  make it as common as ac  heated seats or push button start ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2273,ali almarashdah but the audi is actually build like a 100k car and not like a cheap chinese car  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2274,true  but i was talking about the tech not the price  still worth comparing the two of them despite the price difference i think ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2275,ali almarashdah i would say in this case the tesla is probably the closest to the a8  tesla s level 2 autopilot was already left behind by audi s level 3 audi ai  the first and so far the only one to reach this level of autonomous driving  besides all the other features and tech the a8 comes with  that tesla can only dream of now  but these things keep changing all the time  anyways those 2 cars play in completely different leagues   and regardless how crazy and expensive the audi might be  the tesla will always be the best  being an electric  which is what a lot of people want ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2276,it would be nice for marques to chech it out though  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2281,michael riveccio i did not get a bolt because it is so uggo,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2282,chemtrail dreams you are not wrong  i do not think it is all that great looking either  i do not think it is hideous  but it is no tesla  if you can get over the looks  it is a nice little car  it drives nice  it is roomy inside  i like it so far ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2283,what about the new  2nd gen  nissan leaf ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2284,michael riveccio i have a 500e which is all i needed  but i would like that kind of styling in a car as good as the bolt,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2285,the leafs batteries suck and loose capacity at a stupidly quick rate compared to tesla s cells,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
2286,michael riveccio everyone i have met that has a bolt says it feels cheap and poorly made  and they will not purchase after their lease is up,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2287,michael riveccio not even close competition ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2288,i think the tesla is a much more luxurious and refined car  not to mention it is musk s,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2289,j and j studio the bolt is not even close to the model 3 that is in this video  this model 3 costs nearly  60 000  i am talking the base model  so the smaller battery  no glass roof  no upgraded sound system  no autopilot  etc  tesla is trying to market the model 3 as a mass market  affordable ev  however every review i see is talking about a version that is in the high  50 thousands  that is not affordable for most people  now i know that the base model is not even available yet  so it is impossible to review  however  i think that when you compare apples to apples  the bolt would compare pretty well to it  it has a slightly longer range  more spacious interior  more cargo space  with the rear seats folded flat  it does not look as good  handle as nice  or accelerate quite as quickly as the model 3  but some buyers might put more emphasis on its other features  for example i live in new england  so the base model 3 s rear wheel drive is basically a deal breaker for me  as much as i like the styling better than the bolt s  the bolt is a better winter driver  i do not think the bolt is poorly made  it is just not luxurious  i had an acura before  it is a huge step down in interior quality from my tsx  i wanted an ev though  and the bolt checked all my required boxes in a vehicle  luxury is nice  but it is not essential to me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2290,michael riveccio when paying  35k for the base model 3   it is no brainer to get the more car for your buck ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2291,haniho ho are you saying that it is a no brainer to add nearly  10 000 to the price of the car to get a more luxurious car with the tesla bells and whistles  sure  if you have the money to spare  but that is not the supposed point of the model 3  it is supposed to be an affordable long range ev that can compete with price wise with mass market sedans  it is targeted at people like me  i was looking for a new car  i wanted an ev  but i did not want to pay much more than i would had i gotten a top end accord or low end luxury model  something like an acura ilx  i was not going to pay  55 grand for the long range model 3  it is just too much  especially considering that i ended up purchasing my bolt  when it seemed like the new tax bill was going to eliminate the federal ev credit   the bolt was the only long range ev in my price range  and even that was at the higher end of it  i think a lot of people are in the same boat as me  they would like an ev  but they need them to be closer to that   30 000 price point in order for them to make sense financially  that is why i think a bolt vs  base model 3 would be interesting to a lot of people  those are the only two relatively affordable long range evs  i think people would like to know how they compare dollar to dollar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2292,michael riveccio i am saying the base model 3 is the better car than the bolt for the same price  the rear panoroof is standard that makes the cabin more roomy  there is heated front seats a faster more modern infotainment   and speakers better than the standard 3 series  for cargo there is frunk trunk capacity  along with seats folded down makes it very comparable to the bolt  there is more center console storage without the gear knob  and there is a phone dock for two and a rear armrest with cupholders  the smartphone is your keyless entry  the 3 has faster acceleration and sporty handling which is more fun  along with it looking way nicer in and out   the autopilot features is likely to be free  when self driving is the norm  so it is more future proof than the bolt that does not get ota updates ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2293,haniho ho charging is faster too  that is the big drawback of the bolt  even on a ccs charger  the max charging rate is way below the tesla  even worse is that chevy was super conservative with its charging speed taper  so you only get the max charging rate for a small percentage of the battery  the future proof part is what worries me about the bolt  three or four years from now there will probably be a whole bunch of ev options in the  30 000 price range that have more modern charging capabilities  if the ccs infrastructure really develops  i could find myself with an antiquated ev with little resale value  those are the drawbacks  i am worried about that  but i needed a car a few months ago  i could not wait 3 more years  the bolt was  and probably still is  the best  affordable ev on the market right now  so i got one and for now  i am pretty happy with the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2323,for less than the base price of that car you could get a cadillac xts premium has nearly all the bells and whistles possible  with less than 20k miles  certified with 100k miles bumper to bumper warranty   sure it uses gas  and tesla might be ahead in some areas of the touch screen experience  but it is still missing a lot for the price   even non used around 50k would be quite the step up from this car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2324,i genuinely think you r the best tech reviewer on the planet but when it comes to car review i do think you need to get better shots more stable showcase the car a bit better nd maybe give us a better sense of how it feels to drive it it will probably be expensive but it will attract a lot more viewers there are already so many dope car reviewing channels out there so i think you need to up your game also make more videos please you r making us wait too long  cannot wait for the next one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2453,sinsertorio i have seen a brand new renault in years like for real  also even if tesla ends up failing the technology they have pioneered is pretty amazing  and can i just ask why your defending huge car manufacturers like people do with phone companies i mean the more competition the better and also at the end of the day your probably getting a little screwed by them all,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2454,if they would aggressively start making only electric cars  then yeah  but right now i do not think so,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2456,tech blogger the batteries they use are not even theirs ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2457,i mean  cars  phone manufacturers do not always make the parts themselves  they buy parts from each other  so  saying that tesla do not make their own battery cells means they would fail is like saying apples would fail because they buy their camera chips from samsung   sony  it is absurd  nowadays  cars are sold as technology packages  like  you would not buy a car in 2018 without a touchscreen  bluetooth  android auto  so  in the range of  30 45k  tesla offers a very competitive package for everyday commute  plus  without what tesla s doing  there would not have been any electric cars coming out of the  big manufacturers  the reason you do not see more teslas in other states are because of dealership lobbyists   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2458,i d like to see more cars suvs between the 30 45k range  of course it s fun to watch sports car videos but getting your opinions on relatively realistic price range things would be awesome  i wouldn t be opposed to a f pace or alpha romeo though lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2459,yes  i m german and maybe we exaggerate  i like tesla  but the model 3 isn t a good product in terms of building quality   and why the hell the steering wheel ist this ugly and useless  no buttons  no design  nothing  if i get a phonecall  i must touch the screen  why ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2470,sorry marques but for me your first car review episode is a bit of a let down  structure of the review is 3 out of 10   check out doug demuro s channel for reference  also  your video quality is as low as 4 out of 10 which i think is due to your lack of experience in taking outdoor footage   you can do better  and stop making your friends act like idiots in your videos  you look like a bunch of teenagers with too much money to spend  just a friendly advice ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2471,gave your comment a like because you are right  i do not have a channel of my own to compare  still though  you do not need to be a movie producer in order to be a movie critic  it is no secret that mkbdh has almost zero full length outdoor videos so let us push him to do more of those and better ones  did you not subscribe so you can be entertained ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2547,so marques  i ll probably tell you the good n the bad  good  nice concept great sound quality good job for a first video of this kind bad the quality of the video was honestly very poor   too dark  bad framing  not a complete review of either the car or it is software side of things i felt you lacked the enthusiasm by watching some parts of the video suggestions get a couple of gopro with fixtures and just do the video yourself probably not the best time of the day to do an outdoor review i would not watch your automobile review to help me decide on what car to buy but will watch it to know how the electronics or software side of things work  please focus on that part  it would be good to review car accessories or automobile gadgets  goes with your style more   cheers ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2584,reed pratt you mean screw the software engineers who built it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2585,haniho ho what  just include it in the end price then  do not include everything i need for it and not give it to me because i did not hand you  5000  if they want this car to be economically competitive and actually push volume they should not be charging extra an  1000 for red paint or  5000 for autopilot  honestly just lowering the price by 50  or greater would be a little more reasonable but  5000 for a software license  come on ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2651,the whole concept of getting software updates in order to make the car get better or to unlock features does not make sense to me  for an example  autopilot is a 5000  software update  you have all the censors and computing in the car that you paid for  but you have to pay extra 5k to unlock it  imagine chevy saying  the new silverado is only front wheel drive  do not worry though  it is an easy 2000  software update to get the rwd  and another 2000  to get the 4x4   that is just greedy  all that being said  i still like what tesla is doing  improving electric cars to the point were they actually start to make sense ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2824,amazing  in less than 24 hour there are more than 268k views and more than 32k likes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2825,do the model x  suv ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2826,it is really infotaining  all the best ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2827,i get that you re paying for the technology  but the fact that either way it has all the hardware necessary to autopilot itself and the  5000 is just a software update is pretty hilarious ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2828,well its cheaper to produce all the cars the same  so so actually have to pay for the hardware just if you use it  else the hardware is basicly free  the fee is not jut for the software  you just have to pay for hardware if you use it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2829,it is deceptive that it is  just a software update  because it looks simple and quick to install on your end  significant resources go into making that software and that has to be financed  it is years of work of maybe a hundred engineers and involving thousands of test cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2830,so you paid for a smartphone  does that mean all apps are free ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2831,same thing with the range on models s and x  they all come with the same batteries and only the software determines what your range is  i do not have a problem with it because you can pay less for your car if you already know that you will not be needing that extra range,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2832,rosewolfz prime you are not locked out of the model 3 interface  autopilot is a fully loaded feature  and deserves it is price tag like all other cars on the road with their different options  sound like you want free app features instead of paying for them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2833,rosewolfz prime mercedes distronic control  bmw driving assist  audi traffic assist  they all cost money for those features   are you saying they should be free instead  because you bought the car   these features are like top tier apps   and the car is the smartphone  makes perfect sense ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2834,caleb sevick another example   video games on steam   fresh triple a titles are software downloadable over the air  you want them to be free too  you paid for the pc after all  that does not make any sense  autopilot  a feature not available on hundred thousand dollar bmws  mercedes and audis  and you complain about it not being free ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2835,rosewolfz prime apps get free updates too just like these car options mentioned  oh wait it is just tesla with ota updates   also the hardware suite is active with safety features and live traffic awareness on the display  that is standard on the  35k base model  people that do not want the auto pilot option should have a choice not to get it   just like any other car  or smartphone ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2836,rosewolfz prime you already payed for the fingerprint scanner upfront  you did not pay for autopilot  that no s class  7 series  or a8 offers on the same level   the model s has the same autopilot  and all these are 6 figure cars  for an entry luxury sedan to have autopilot is cheap in comparison  and even in the base model 3  the hardware suite is still actively on in safety features and live traffic info to see cars in deep fog  also autowipers use neural vision from the camera to see the rain and activate   fingerprint scanner is laughable compared to the value and complexity of autopilot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2837,rosewolfz prime smartphones are built in features to use apps  otherwise those apps would not work on old nokias   built in capabilities does not mean any new software is free ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2838,rosewolfz prime you are the one who compared a simple fingerprint scanner to a self driving system ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2864,try uploading 1080 60 fps instead of 4k and stuff especially in car reviews,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2865,please do not  4k is gorgeous,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2866,rec film school 4 screens are very rare and serve no point with youtube compression  60 fps is definitely noticeable when compared to 4k,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2867,4k is especially important because of the youtube compression as you have way worse quality in 1080p ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2868,four fhd screens are rare  yes   one 4k monitor is rather common these days  marques uses 4k resolution so that his work will  not  be outdated in a few years  when fhd will be obsolete  it is like asking for a headphone jack   he knows it is dying and therefore not worth investing into   one more thing  he has a  red that shoots 8k  why not 4k 60fps   because most computers that can handle 4k cannot handle 4k60  why not fhd 60fps   because it will be outaded very soon,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2869,some of us like to watch youtube on our beautiful 4k televisions  like rec said  4k is gorgeous  let it be  by the way  while 4k monitors are rare  4k televisions are like the new standard here in sweden and most likely in most rich countries  going to buy a new tv  well then it will be one with 4k  the prices went down so much these last two years ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
2870,canal ten thousand  ok let it be i just need the option of 60 fps becoz in car reviews you would notice it 4k 60 fps would be great ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

2874,sphere suspension is the most confortable suspension you can get on a car  however  it s expensive and that s not what tesla is looking for on this car hence why they went for the coil ones,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3019,feedback for you  please fade the music a lot if you are talking about the car  i noticed that in many parts of the video  when you are talking  the music does not need to play that loudly or even at all  wish this car had a traditional dashboard  this is really a deal breaker for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3100,goooooood,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3101,reading the comments and everyone seems pretty happy with your review  but i think that if you want to review cars you need to know a bit more about them  car specs  you always cover specs  you talked about the suspension  but was it sporty  was it comfortable  compared to what  how are the seats  how is the legroom in the back  what is the turning radius  what is the volume of the trunk  there is a million different things to focus on and cover on a car video  of course  you will always focus on the tech side of automobiles more  but just as you do with gadgets  you should try to cover every single aspect of it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3110,absolutely fantastic review   initially i did not know i was interested in this car  but dayum now i want one  haha   great video as always ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3111,i m sorry  but for that price  that shitty interior is ridiculous  just because you put a big screen in the middle doesn t make it worth 60 000  everything in there  bar the screen  looks low quality  steering wheel  dashboard  and there is no reason not to include actual gauges in your car other than cheapness  you can get a lot more car than that for 35 000  and at 60 000 i don t know why anyone would ever consider it   end rant,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3112,mitchell faughnan i think it s actually 35 000 if i m correct,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3113, mitchell faughnan you like gauges behind the steering wheel then buy the chevy bolt  tesla cars are for the ones who enjoy driving  not looking at gauges ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3114,for that price you buy groundbreaking powertrain  not finest interior  if you want smelly outdated powertrain with finest interior  buy bmw or vw ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3115,fantastic review  cool car  but for me it s missing 2 key points  a high reving meaty sounding internal combustion engine and a manual gearbox  i know electric is the future  it s really cool tech and at some point everyone will have one  but i guarantee that if you ever find an electric car in my garage there will definitely be a real car next to it   no amount of electricity can replace a real engine note and the joy of rowing it through the gears yourself  don t get me wrong i m not bashing electric cars  i think they are fantastic  it definitely makes sense for everyone in the long run  i d love to own one   i m all for them as long as they don t completely kill off my exploding petrol machines ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3116,matthew gerlag  do not worry  they will not   just like your exploding petrol machines did not kill off horse drawn carriages   maybe we will still see them in parades  or pay a fee to drive our sweetheart around in one at christmas time   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3117, matthew gerlag   cool car  but for me it s missing 2 key points  a high reving meaty sounding internal combustion engine and a manual gearbox  which car is this   honda s2000  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3118,ht n  i wasn t referring to anything specific  anything loud and powerful mated to a manual transmission  here s some of my personal favourite examples  ford mustang gt350r  or pretty much any manual muscle car for that matter  ford focus rs  or pretty much any manual hot hatch for that matter  frankly anything with a proper soul that when you drive it makes you want to drive it harder and harder   sure you can find elements of that feeling in say a tesla model s and it s instant torque when you launch it  the thing is that cars like that in my opinion are a bit of a one trick pony  my whole enjoyment of a car is how engaging and rewarding it is to drive  reving it out  letting the engine sing is rewarding to me  rowing it through the gears is engaging for me  these are two elements you can t find in an electric vehicle ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3119,you are not bashing electric cars but you are implying they are not real when you said  i guarantee that if you ever find an electric car in my garage there will definitely be a real car next to it  ok  personally  i like the roar of a fossil fuel car s engine  it is cool  but i am willing to sacrifice that if it gives me the opportunity to help our environment  sure  tesla s batteries may not be 100  safe or risk free but in my opinion it is still better than the traditional fossil fuels we know  also  this is a ridiculous idea but maybe in the future  when electric cars become more popular  people might then make modifications like adding a fake engine roar so people like you can still enjoy an  engine note  sure it is fake hence ridiculous but it is the kind of fake that is actually good for everybody   lastly  just like what marques said  it is probably beneficial that the car is quiet so that drivers can actually pay more attention to what is happening outside  same is true with pedestrians because they or we are now dealing with silent cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3120,rigel sinco i ll admit i was a little cheeky with that remark  i wanted to add a little humour  you may read it how you wish  i ll understand why  but i m really not bashing electric cars  the reason i said what i said is that in my mind driving a less engaging electric car feels more to me like the car is simply transportation  getting from a to b and not engaging in the experience of driving  especially with auto pilot  i know that sounds silly but to me cars are so much more  i sometimes go out for a drive just for the shear heck of it  even if i have nowhere to go  and my fiesta st never ceases to put a smile on my face  i just struggle to see how a completely silent semi self driving car can give me the same smile  it just seems like it would be a little bit soulless  i ve never personally driven an electric car so i have an open mind for when i do  but if i look at all the aspects i enjoy about my car they just seem absent in an electric car  hence why i feel this way  don t get me wrong i am in no way against electric cars either  you are correct in what you say  in a lot of ways they are superior  one day i will probably own one  honestly some days when i m tired doing the daily commute and stuck in traffic and i can t have any fun in my car i d take a silent self driving car everyday of the week  that s why i d own one for the boring commute  plus the fact that i d be saving the planet and not spending money on fuel is very appealing to me  thing is i d still want a  real  car for that sunday afternoon when you find a nice twisty set and have a little fun or just tank it down the open road listening to a real engine note  look  i consider myself a petrol head so i completely understand if not everyone enjoys the same pleasure   adding fake engine sounds   try telling that to a petrol head in person  and then come back here and tell me how hard he she smacked you  you seem like a nice fella so i m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and take that whole paragraph as a form of sarcastic humour  i already hate it when companies like bmw play fake engine notes through the sound system to  enhance  the theatre in certain modes   they re definitely not the only ones  in cars like that you can hear it s artificial and soulless even with the real engine undertone  no  just no  i ll rather sit in silence than have artificial rubbish played through the speakers  otherwise i might as well go play need for speed on my computer   also  one thing an electric car will never be able to have is 3 pedals and an h pattern  that form of engagement with the car is an important aspect of my driver enjoyment  i m sure one day some muppet will try mate a manual transmission to an electric motor but it would be completely and utterly stupid not to mention inefficient and completely pointless  i have to say that i disagree with your last paragraph  engine sounds are a safety feature in my opinion  maybe more so for everyone else around you especially pedestrians and cyclists  sure at higher speeds you ll be able to hear the tyre roar  but not at slower speeds in residential areas  plus i d probably be more likely to fall asleep behind the wheel if my car were any quieter ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3121,fair points  i guess you are seeing driving as a form of art based on your sentiments and i understand  i am also not being sarcastic about the fake engine sound thingy  for me  it is a silly trade off  but a trade off i am willing to do if it means i would contribute into making the world a better place and enjoying something i love to hear as a part of what i love to do  i am sorry but i still disagree with engine sounds as a safety feature because you will still have a brake and a horn built in an electric car  not to mention the addition of sensors to assist you further  as for cyclists and pedestrians  they too should also pay attention to where they are heading   hopefully  in a future where electric cars dominate the world  fossil fuel driven cars owned by responsible petrol heads like you will still have a place  maybe not on the highways on a daily basis but on race tracks for that enjoyment and pleasure you seek  thanks for the good conversation ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3122,i do not like red on cars and i have seen the red model 3 and did not like it  especially in the front  just looked too much like a porsche to me and i do not like porches   but over all the styling is good on the model 3  once again opinion  and for a realistic starting price of 45k for an all electric car having this good of a build quality it is definitely worth the extra initial money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3156,a lot of people here are fanboying but the production of the video isn t great at all  i still love this channel though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3157,i completely agree  the quality standards were not anywhere near what you usually see in his videos  it is fairly clear that this was the first video format of this type he is attempted  filming cars is very different from filming tech phones  it takes some time to understand the approach to both   pretty decent for a first attempt  however there is definitely room for improvement in future videos ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3158,the footage was shakey as hell,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3159,i see people fanboying about the graphics and intro  which are top notch  the maps and the intro are really clean  mkbhd style  but you are right about the rest  you can tell it is not a pro team in car videos  i watch a lot of car shows lmao and the differences are clear  i would recommend watching some motor trend  top gear  the grand tour  carfection  petrolicious  even motorweek retro  or more homemade shows like the smoking tire or mighty car mods to capture some of the recording style  i am not saying it is easy at all doing it  but it is not something unperceptible ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3160,agree  but the opening graphics were on point  videography can be improved though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3161,well  in his defence  he is not used to shooting outdoors and secondly out door shooting conditions are not always ideal  yeah  it is not as amazing as most of his other videos but is it more than enough to enjoy the content and absorb the information he is giving to us  i would say yes  but yeah  there is some places for him to improve if we consider production value alone  but i never thought if his videos as eyes candies so i never noticed anything bad when i watched it first  i create tech related contents  if you are free please do try my channel out  i will appreciate it quite a lot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3186,i guess its the black that is the standard color and if you want any other color option you will have to pay for that  i personally do not think a color add on is that bad but others seems a bit too expensive considering how they are really useful for an electric car such as improved range and autopilot  so  basically the  35000 is more like the price for the barebones of the car and if you want to make it a tesla  then you will have to pay something close to  55000  i do tech related contents  if you are free please do give my channel a look  i will greatly appreciate it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3283,well  all tesla cars have that look to curved look to it not everyone would prefer that  so i suppose it is totally fine for them to be not that great looking as long as they are functional and is affordable  just like he mentioned in this video it is really hard to consider this as a  30000 car as most people would actually go for some of these additional add ons that will put this at  50000  car for most people  still cheaper than other tesla but still not super budget  i do tech based contents  if you got some free time please do give my channel a look ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3284,matthew that is the msrp price of it  35k  it initially was touted for getting federal tax credit for being electric which would take another  7 off  but i believe that was for the first 200k so sales    problem is two fold   the delivery of it super slow  tesla has missed both their projected margins on the model 3 and the ones that are rolling out right now are required with options that raising the price up to  50k       on the other hand chevrolet is soaring in sales of it is bolt that affordable and offer more mile range  and it is hatchback ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3297,i would buy one of these in a heart beat ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3298,i love the model 3  i just do not know how i feel about tesla locking away the auto pilot behind a payed software update when i would already own the stuff needed to have it  i love tesla as a company  but that just eats away at me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3299,  would you rather they not put the hardware in unless you pay   that way  if you want to upgrade  you would have to buy a brand new car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3300,joshua you did not pay for the hardware in the base price  tesla puts the same hardware in every single car and bets on enough people purchasing it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3301, ardy s op  joshua   you already paid for the hardware in the base price  no  you did not pay for enhance autopilot hardware  the autopilot hardware is included with all car for free  only when buyers owners select to pay  5 000 when order the car or  6 000 later then the software will be installed ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3302,you are wrong  you get fooled by the fact that the hardware is installed and therefore you paid for it   take a cruise ship  yes all the hardware is installed on board but if you want to use stuff you have to pay  getting and the ship does not includ eevrything   so yes they install hardware on every car since its more efficent  but you just have to pay for it if you use it  else its just added weight,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3303,marvin that is the worst example ever  you do not buy the cruise ship  you pay for the cruise itself not the actual ship lol  this car is something you buy and own  you own all the cameras and hardware required for autopilot  they are your property  i understand having to pay for the software  but  5 000  that is far too much ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3304,you still do not get it  your mind just cannot wrap around something like that  you think hey i own all the hardware therefore i payed for it  tesla is basicly expecting most of the people to use their autonomus driving feature and therefore do not want to waste money on a spec without those  yes it cost money a develop and produce car parts even when you leave out features  so they basicly gift you all the hardware and even lose money if you do not buy the package  therefore these 5000 money are not just for the software ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3305,i get what you mean but no  you pay for a product then you own that product  it really is that simple ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3306,joshua  all tesla s have the cameras in place to use the safety features of autopilot in the base price the 5000  would be to use the convenience features of autopilot  because the software to generate that costs a lot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3325,starting at  35000 is not affordable  yeah  i know    7500 tax credit  but the battery life in the starter model is not good enough for normal people  the dashboard experience is garbage without the autopilot experience to complete it   and the interior is bad  why are hvac controls limited to the screen  why so many things with the spring  it is inconvenient and i am going to  a bit too far and highly distracting for the driver  basically  i do not see how this is a successful  affordable  car when an acceptable version of it will likely cost over or around  30000 after tax credit but adding in an option or two  you want an affordable car  buy a ford focus  a kia rio  a honda fit  or some other small car that is plenty reliable and wayyy cheaper  affordable starts at 20k  not 35k ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3440,thanks,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3441,personally  i do not trust autopilot  too easy for people to hack  i would gladly save 5000 dollars and get a silent commuter with tons of trunk space ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3442,jacob welte  yes   you pay  5k to activate autopilot when you buy  or  6k after delivery    you can get another  1k discount by pre paying for  full self driving     3k instead of  4k   but that is non refundable and there is not a guaranteed date when the capability will become available   if you have  1k lying around and are confident tesla will release the software in the next 3 5 years  it may be worth it  but if not ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3443,d  e  bodiford i hope you are joking because autopilot is not easy to hack  it is pretty much impossible and no one is going to target you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3444,izybit izybit it is happening in news articles around the world  google it  i will not leave my safety  security  and life to a car that can be hacked  among other flaws with the concept of tesla  you do you  but it is a solid no for me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3445, d  e  bodiford   i do not trust autopilot  too easy for people to hack  then do not use laptop  notebook  cell phone   they are easy to hack too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3446, d  e  bodiford     well best not buy a tesla then   they all have a sim card and are permanently in touch with tesla over the mobile phone network and or wifi  the steering and accelerator are all electronic and computer controlled so if you are worried someone might hack and steer you into a concrete wall while your car s accelerator was on full power with or without autopilot  this is not the car for you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3449,nope  the hardware is already there  you can get the autopilot as a software update,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3450,d  e  bodiford no  you show me when people were driving their teslas and someone half way across the world hacked the car  as for the 40000 battery cost  you are plain stupid  the whole car is cheaper than that ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
3451,izybit izybit i googled my info  i did the research  just open the app and look for solutions to a dead tesla battery  as for hacking  news reports say that a group of chinese hackers remotely drove a tesla 12 miles  they are not the only ones either ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3452,d  e  bodiford you should read those articles better  what you claim is happening is not happening  if you are afraid of hacking you can unplug the antennas and access to the internet is blocked permanently  as for the battery  i have no idea what you are trying to say ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3453,izybit izybit when the battery gives out  the cost of the replacement and the cost of work needed to be done  totals  40 000 according to jalopnik and and other news outlet articles ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3499,that mustang at the end was like   later nerds ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
3500,exactly what i was thinking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3501,ford mustang   the most pointless and least practical car the world has ever seen  yea it looks alright on the outside but that is about it  interior is crowded and horrible  revs like a bitch and eats petrol the same way to produce a lot of noise and not a lot of point  base model of that atrocity in the uk accelerates 0 62 in 5 8 seconds  which is slower than the base model 3 and costs exactly the same  actually more if we include ev incentive of  4500  so get a mustang  which is slower and is way more expensive to drive  for the same money as model 3  meh ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3502,neither of us said anything about mustangs being inherently better  but we are still allowed an opinion  personally i would much rather have another mustang because i love the looks  love the sound  and love working on cars  the tesla does none of those things for me  so i would never pick one over a mustang if i was buying new ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3503,aleksandr vysockij it is not about the mustang  i know it is nothing more than a loud horsepower mammoth  it is about this whole electric car thing in general  they say it is eco friendly but at the end of the day  the raw materials and the production process itself end up  consuming nature   as they call it  i am not one of those nature lover retards  the only good to the environment they do is not polluting the air in non industrial areas  but all that for what  a vehicle with no real thrill to drive  sit back and relax  where is the fun in that  where is the roar  where is the satisfaction you get when you change the gear properly  unless of course if you are some 12 y o nerd who loves futuristic things   and yes  electric vehicles are faster than gas driven  there are technical reasons behind it  no shift delays  less weight and as such  but all that aside  it takes the soul of driving out of it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3504,that  soul  often said to be lacking in evs is highly subjective  it is exactly the lack of mechanisms the spools  the turbos that excite me about the car  like the thing s been streamlined to peak efficiency its powertrain stripped of non essentials  like a lithe ambush predator  like thunder less lightning  and the point of the ev revolution is not to avoid consumption completely and absolutely  that would be impossible and in strict violation with the universe  but to lessen it significantly  the point is not to stop polluting at all  but to lower environmental impact over the lifetime of the vehicle  start small somewhere and build up over time  the satisfaction to be found here is in uninterrupted  unadulterated  disquieting acceleration  that and a lower maintenance bill due to fewer moving parts   though your mileage may vary on that last bit ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3562,a big fan of yours here  the content review is great as usual  but it felt like the video quality can get better  you have always made really polished tech videos  but this being a car review  aesthetically speaking  does not match up to the rest of your videos  just my opinion  peace   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3569,blaine d  he s a tech reviewer first and foremost  and it shows  didn t talk in any great detail about driving dynamics  daily drivability  or even a comparison with the car s competition  like the 3 series  a4 or c class  so yeah  seasoned car reviewers are still better at reviewing cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3570,aria pegah i disagree   simple because he made a car review entertaining and watchable for an entirely new demographic  versus the traditional  spec overload  car reviews ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3573,just out of sympathy for marques i would say this was an ok review  considering that he is a tech guy and not a car guy  but this was far from being a good car review  he focused way to much on all the software features and missed talking about the car itself almost entirely ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3580,most tesla model 3 on the street are going to be more expensive  you are predicting something that you can t  the lower end of the market does not care at all about any of those options as long as they can get a decent all electric tesla  for example  let us compare the guy who buys the bmw 3 vs those who buy the 7 series and you will see most 3 series are actually base models bought by people who just want a bmw  all reviewers need to get that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3591,does the bmw have autopilot  auto lane change hands free autopark  easter egg menu  and summoning out of puddles  how about  autopilot live information of cars all around and ahead even in fog on an apple like gui that is the fastest on the market  bmw still is not faster than one s smartphone   and a large touchscreen that is brighter and better quality than an ipad pro  with a large back up camera that can be left on while driving  along with huge navigation map that is highly responsive   voice commands that plays songs instantly   rear helicopter panoramic roof for the rear passengers  and another panoramic roof for the front passengers  auto wipers that utilizes the camera and not an outdated rain sensor  and auto charge port that lights up   deep center console storage frunk and deep well trunk with no tunnel hump  audio system that is better than a 3 series   smartphone app key that preheats the car  one of kind hvac system that is aesthetically pleasing and is more intuitive than upfront air vents  0 60 in 4 6 seconds  and ota updates  camper mode  listening to audio inside a closed garage  and outside heats up in under 2 4 minutes in negative temps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3598,why is not autopilot standard ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3599,when full self driving becomes norm  it probably will   the software side might be the free windows 10 update to the standard hardware ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3600,azalru if the tech is already on the car seems awfully expensive to pay to just unlock it  that is all i am getting at  this is supposed to be a budget  car and tesla is known for their auto pilot  would have been a nice standard feature ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3610,5k for what seems to be lane assist w  adaptive cruise control seems excessive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3611,lane assist and adaptive cruise control  are not as responsive and smooth to be called autopilot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3612,dat new intro ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3613,for me  tesla cars are beautiful at the exterior  but the interior is really soul les  the design just has no flow or class  and the steering wheel  s  just centered around the screen  that is not beautifuly integraded  volvo s for instance have beautiful interiors  with a flow and class  though not a fan of the flow and wheel in the newest models ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3614,this is more scandinavian than volvo  their head interior designer anders bell left volvo last year and is actually now at tesla probably for the refresh model s x line  i expect the seamlessly integrated hvac system to make it to the refresh  upfront airvents are ugly and disrupt the dash  the single slit takes care of that behind a simple dash that is very striking  it feels like a home desktop setup with the apple like screen ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3615,for me the exterior is more important than the interior when it comes to looks   as long the exterior is lit since that is what people get to see first and the interior is comfy since its more about how i feel in the car then i am sold ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3616,the screencentricity has a purpose  in this way they are not limited by buttons and stalks in post production upgrades of their cars  tesla is the only carmaker that upgrades cars it sold years ago for free  like a new driving mode for example ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3617,i agree  i hate the steering wheel  looks so cheap  and i hate that you do not have an instrument cluster like the model s and you always need to look to the right to check your speedometer  that needs to change  at least they can install a heads up display,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3618,must be subjective because i love the simplicity of the model 3 interior,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3619,simplicity can be nice when done correctly  but it is not really simplicity in my mind  the design of the interior feels more like and after thought  but he you cannot argue taste right p,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3620,i do not care about scandinavian or not  i am just talking about it is interior design  not if it has a style like scandinavian ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3621,yes the screen is very important  but with that being said  they could have done it nicer  somehow implement it better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3622,audi  sorry  but their interior looks awful  and that navigation looks like an after market part ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3623,this  at  alex,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3624,i think it is meant to be used completely by autopilot in the future  and hence the sole big screen  because you will not drive it like a regular car  but interact with it via the screen  also  i guess the interior is minimal to keep the cost down ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3625,i prefer the minimalism ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3652,i took delivery of my 3 back in december  i find the build quality to be significantly better than my x and pretty great overall  but others did not agree in my model 3 build quality video  as far as issues they are relatively minor   phone key works 98  of the time  ride is a bit harsh  auto dimming mirrors do not work properly yet  otherwise  i have been very happy with the car  and the best part of all no rattles  look forward to your car videos   my model 3 wishlist    phone key linked with driver s profile   rear seat heating control   web browser   auto dimming mirrors   prevent car from waking up at home  phone keeps going in and out of range    energy graph   ac control steering wheel buttons   alert if door left open,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3688,most 30k ice vehicles are actually worth 25k after dealer markups and subsidise   real cost of gas is 7 10  dollars per gallon but we the citizens subsidize the cost with our tax dollars to give illusion of lowered gas prices   if we let markets work properly  the demand for alternative energy vehicles would bloom  much like smart phone tech    we subsidize evs  because there is no demand and only now we are seeing the future due to tesla innovating ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3695,nomadic julien tried to spec it out as close as i could  ended up being just shy of  50k  but then again  it still takes gas and lacks a few things that you can only get with tesla and a few select other cars  it does show how adding just a few options here and there can take a similarly base priced car up to a similar optioned price,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3805,kobethagoat bryant i got to agree with you there  the model 3 is supposed to be an affordable ev but  57k puts it into bmw 5 series and e class territory  a  25k model 3 with an optioned out version at  35k would be killer value ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3806,but you have to put  100 in gas every week with those other options,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3807,i think this car is amazing for 57k even though a brand new bmw 5 series is tempting,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3808,if you drove 500km 300miles  per week at  1 20 per litre it will cost you  30 for a small audi or at the most  60 for a supercar  let us average  50  then you have to account for electricity costs for the model 3  which has a 75kwh battery  which would cost  25 to charge at a charge rate efficiency of 80  in my area  now assuming that it can actually do the claimed 500km from a charge for the whole life of the battery i bet it cannot  it will take over 15 years to break even with a larger audi and probably never for a small car  then there is digital rot  everyone will think you are selling it because the battery is bung it probably is  and pay you nothing making the loss even more for resale  this is based on a  20000 replacment battery  given that the upgrade is  9000 its probably more than that also ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3811,nathan squire what do you mean by  break even  with an audi  bottom line is assuming both cars are the same price  you would pay less for  fuel  on a bev and save a few thousand over the life of the car  not to mention the maintenance cost on a model 3 will be far less than a similarly priced ice auto  and the fact that the model 3 comes with the hardware for full autonomous driving built in definitely helps the resale value  you should watch teslanomics by ben sullins break down of the depreciation of the model 3  data suggests it will be much better than other similarly priced cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3812,el samurai guapo so how do they fix the rechargable batteries when they start dying too quickly  when my engine dies  my car is 20 years old  when your battery gives out  you pay  40 000 for a full replacement  that is a fact  look it up ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3813,i do not know where you live but unless you commute 100 miles a day noone pays 100  a week in gas  especially considering a lot of audi s  bmw s  and mercedes have high quality cars that get 35 mpg  any way you look at it 57 000 is a lot for what you get on the model 3  though if it was closer to 35k specced out then yeah it would be a no brainer  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3969,0 48 i like that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3970,great start to a series  good amount of detail without too much fluff  only thing i would suggest is smooth panning shots  the shaky panning when you would drove by really stood out and was distracting ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3971,so basically  autopilot is day one paid dlc   what the fuck tesla ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
3972,so once your on the highway you can autopilot  or can it also work on side streeets ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3973,this wbite mustang at the end is much better car for the money  electric cars are not quite here yet  not high range  slow charging  making them produce much more charm to environment then making normal ones  recycling of battery s in future is horrible  i hate that glass roof because when it s sunny it s super annoying  let s see what will come in future  i m not convinced yet ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3974,that is fine that you are not convinced yet but plenty of people are  and for plenty of people the things you mentioned like range and charging speed are non factors  why would the average american  who drives less than 50 miles a day  be concerned when they can charge at home and basically wake up to a  full tank  every day  i drive more than 220 miles at once maybe 4 times a year  only in those situations would charging speed be a factor but overall i have saved more of my time throughout the year never having to spend the time driving to a station for gas once a week ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

3979,with the quality of this video i would love to see a model x video  unless you ve already done that and if so plz link lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
3980,the problem is  this car simply is not practical and it will always carry that legacy  tesla is a company based on idealism  not pragmatism  sure it is nice to see the beginning of a possible future of electric cars  but we all need to realize mkb is just a hype beast who gets paid to advertise products  the man uses a pixel 2 xl for christ s sake  obviously he is biased  and will pay more money for a piece of garbage and go on the internet to sell it because he knows companies will pay good money for 5 7m mindless subscribers who all only watch his channel for its  crispy  video quality over actual quality content ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4015,it feels like an ea car  at first glance  if you want more of the base experience  you need to buy all the dlc  it feels dumb when a software update enables certain aspects of the car  but on the other hand  i get it and it makes sense  developing a good autopilot ai costs a lot of money and buying the first  affordable  mass produced tesla will make you a mini medici of future electric cars  it still not as expensive as a model s  which is great  anyhow  as always this is a great first look in what is to come and i thoroughly enjoy your content  cannot wait for episode 2 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4143, not a lot of  40   50 000 cars have auto park  this is completely false  a lot of cars in that price range have auto park  i am a fan of tesla  but elon has significantly oversold bang for the buck in the model 3  feature for feature  it is just too expensive  especially considering that the tax credit is due to run out for tesla this year ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4144,hands free autopark  how about autolane change  and constantly improving autopilot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4145,azalru elon has said repeatedly and unequivocally that the base model with no options with be the best car that you can buy for  35 000  ignoring tax incentives  that car has no lane keep assist  much less auto lane change  no android auto or car play  no adaptive cruise control  no lane departure warning  no heated seats or steering wheel  no power adjusting seats  and just over 200 miles of range  there are many  many cars that cost less than  35 000 and yet still include all of these features  with ranges of up to 700 miles  i know evs have certain inherent benefits  but the model 3 is still expensive for the features you are getting ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4146,the base model has front heated seats  autopilot live information of cars all around and ahead even in fog  apple like gui on ipad pro responsive ui that is the fastest on the market  large touchscreen that is brighter and better quality than an ipad pro  with a large back up camera that can be left on while driving  rear helicopter panoramic roof for the rear passengers  auto wipers that utilizes the camera and not an outdated rain sensor  auto charge port that lights up  deep center console storage  frunk and deep well trunk with no tunnel hump  audio system that is better than a 3 series   smartphone app that preheats the car  one of kind hvac system that is aesthetically pleasing and is more intuitive than upfront air vents  0 60 near 5 seconds  and ota updates   700 miles is pointless if you have to go on gas errands in the freezing cold and then pay for it   220 miles is more than enough for daily driving  and the supercharger network is widespread for road trips  with the tax credit you can get autopilot  and even later when selfdriving becomes norm  it might even be for free ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4147,azalru first of all  please show me one reliable source confirming heated front seats in the base model with no options  everything i have read indicates that it does not  base model does not have autopilot  i think you know this  it is an option that you have to pay significantly for  the tax credit will be expired before anyone not already on the reservation list gets a model 3  and many on the reservation list already will not get the credit  the size of the touchscreen is irrelevant  it looks cool and fancy  but it is not utilitarian  i actually happen to like physical knobs for most car controls  you can use them without looking  unlike a touchscreen  rain sensors work perfectly fine  i could not care less about the audio  but most cars in the  35 000 range can include audio upgrades  many cars have a smartphone app that can turn on the ac or heater  that is been a thing for years  the hvac system is pretty cool  but not a killer feature  again  0 60 time is irrelevant for daily drivers  i am not sure what you mean by  errands in the freezing cold and then pay for it  gas cars heat you with the wasted heat of the engine  rather than cutting a huge chunk out of your range  that is why lack of heated seats on the base model is such a big deal  look  if you think the model 3 is a bargain  go for it  i was super excited about the model 3  i got on the reservation list the day of the announcement  but i am looking at things realistically  and the value proposition just is not there  the base model with no options is nothing special  and lacks tons of important features that i can get for much cheaper  and i definitely cannot afford the  50 000  model that actually does include all the cutting edge awesome features  nor can most people ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4148,model 3 owners club posted the standard list including heated front seats  even you do not get autopilot  the autopilot display is still on  showing all the related information  everyone who has seen the screen knows this   the big touchscreen has a huge navigation map  and back up camera  and will be used for movies  completely relevant to the half million reservists with some that will get the tax credit  physical knobs and buttons are ugly just like blackberries and nokias  they do not fit with our modern tech filled lifestyles and everyday smartphones   neural vision works better than rain sensors  audio upgrades still not as good as the base model 3   very few actually and still not as good as the smartphone app from silicon valley   and only tesla can turn on climate control in a closed garage   the hvac is better than fiddling with manual air vent multiple times as you sit back  acceleration is completely relevant for highways   and noted by the whole industry advertising it   is more important than your love for buttons   gas cars turn off while you get outside and pump gas  and pay for it in inclement weather  tesla owners do not suffer this reoccurring chore    heated seats are standard on the base model 3  i find other cars that do not have the feature set of the model 3   a complete waste of money  like paying for an old flip phone for the price a modern smartphone flagship ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4216,no one will care in 2 years when it is incomparably much better at driving itself than best human driver ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4217,i think tesla is doing a very good job  it is a nice looking car  and it is clean  no gas  on another side though  i do not know how i feel about not hearing the engine  if i hear my engine  my car is talking to me  when hearing nothing  i mean  it must be nice at times  but sometimes  you just want to hear that engine  but that is just me though  i get that a tesla is cool and has some great tech and if you care about environment  and have the money  because come on   57  give or take  that being said  i bought a new car myself a bit more over a year ago  it is nothing special but i love it  it is a suv  seat ateca  very beautiful with 150hp  like i said  nothing special  but a beautiful car  at least i think so  nonetheless  it is in samoaorange  i also bought it with full option  it has automatic driving  and does the same  automatic braking and reaccelerate  so has a sort of autopilot  and it can also park itself with the push of a button  i can also wirelessly charge my iphone x  have 2 usb slots and 2 sd slots  and it has a great 700 watt soundsystem  glass roof and rear view camera  though of course  in a tesla  those screens are as big  if even not bigger as an ipad  which i like  p   i have also heated leather seats and two things i think is really cool  it has some led lights inside on the doors which can change of color of course and it has a blindspot detector in the two mirrors to warn if their are cars  which is absolutely great when changing lanes  i think everyone should get this option  total cost of the car was around  44 000 so  after i gave my car as deposit and i got some other nice conditions from the garage itself the car came at around  31 000 so that is a difference of around  20 000  but electric will be the future i think  if we want  clean air  i think it is a good start if those prices came down  but tesla of course  has no competition in this field  not as great as the tesla anyway  so until that happens  the average consumer will have to wait  unless they got the money of course    but anyway  sorry for the long comment  i love your reviews and video s  been following you for a long time  as always  great video marques,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4418,we got to pay 5 grand more to enable feature that is already built in and paid for  wtf ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4419,the car is not profitable at  35k with all those hardware gizmos built in  but they promised  35k so there you have it  however  no one is going to complain that it is  43k in two years when tesla will beam your fulltime designated ai driver down from the cloud  he can work for you taxing your car when not using it  bringing your monthly cost of ownership down close to zero ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4420,nice video bro      ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4421,but how does it smell,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4422,this should have heads up display for the mph and gas gauge at least elon missed the mark on that one safety feature,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4423, so if every tesla vehicle already has the necessary hardware for auto pilot then why are they charging you  5000 to utilize it  seems like one of those shitty practices from the big car manufacturers that needs to go away  that is a question that i have always wanted to ask vehicle manufacturers  that  5000 is being charged to have someone click a few buttons on a computer somewhere  all the hard work has already been done ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4424,because software costs money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4425,well could someone hypothetically hack it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4426,richard soper think of it as not costing  5k more but rather save the  5 in case you don t want that or want to save  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4427,bumblemus prime i wonder if the car computer is x86 64 based,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4428,same with the battery  it is bigger in the model s but you have to pay to unlock it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4429,richard soper that s an ignorant argument  think of building a pc with a good cpu  graphics card  hard drive  ram  etc  you have the necessary hardware to run 1080p 60fps games  render hd videos  photoshop high quality images  but how do you do all that without the necessary software  os x and windows 10 are not free operating systems  and neither is the tesla autopilot system  sure the process of getting the software to your car is seamless  but the work involved in development and testing of the system software had much more to it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4430,it is like a phone you are mainly paying for hardware you decide if you want apps music and entertainment,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4431,think about it you moron,[1 0 1 0 1 0]
4432,javian brown the issue is that the software isn t there  it isn t already built in and if in the future someone attempts to use a  jailbreak  autopilot software  tesla will be notified and disable your car  autopilot is an ever growing software that keeps updating itself over time  and i m sure elon has invested a lot into it  do i agree with the  5k price tag  no  but there are some justifiable points to be made as to why it comes with a price tag ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4433,richard soper because hardware alone cannot do shit  it needs the firmware  believe it or not firmwares cost money because it requires work  tons of it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4434,ethan richie i just thought about it for about 5 minutes and i guess it makes sense  deleted my comment as a result  but 5k is crazy  i get how awesome and useful it is and i would certainly pay for it but still,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4435,javian brown my plan is to hopefully get autopilot when full autonomy is legal for cars to drive themselves  hopefully at that time  tesla s rideshare program is in effect and i can list my vehicle into the program so my car can be out giving rides and earning some money all by itself  this is to help compensate costs and once i break even  maybe earn a little side cash if i feel like it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4436,ethan richie oh  i see  i do not have a car but i kind i would want my car to be personal so i would not use that ride share feature  it would feel like handing off my phone to someone  it is my baby,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4457,ok  but is having a car drive you not considered driving under the influence  technically you are supposed to be capable of taking over at any moment  that is where a taxi  uber or a friend is much more useful when you are incapable of driving yourself  also  in this situation  because you are capable of taking control of the vehicle  you should not be allowed to be seated in the drivers seat just in case you do end up becoming in control of the vehicle  legislation on autonomous vehicles is going to be tricky and people need to realize that computers can fail and if and when they do the human needs to be able to take control safely ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4520,what is the actua savings on an electric car over regular fuel  you need a new battery in less than 10 years for over 10k and effiecency is greatly lowered in cold temperatures and with age  there is not even any environmental benefit because they are so fucking expensive to make ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4521,check out more electric cars please   amazing video  we love you mkbhd  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4523,doozytv aren t you afraid of a mistake of yourself ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4524,i can understand this fear  but at the moment the miles  > death ratio is drastically in favour of autopilot  driving yourself is much more dangerous than autopilot  and it is only getting better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4525,bram w that is different  i have no control over how autopilot processes things  i do with myself  and it is relatively new so  i cannot see myself being absolutely confident in autopilot and pay no attention to it at all ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4526,propagandawithasmile how does it behave when another driver does something unexpected or is about to crash into you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4527,doozytv no but he is afraid of replying to you because he wants people to think that he is too cool for that  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4528,doozytv maybe look it up if you re that interested  don t just denounce something you know nothing about,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4529,will not happen  not if like mkbhd if you use it sparingly  start and stop traffic  highway driving  those are low risk environments anyway since most accidents happen on normal roads  where human judgement comes into play more ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4530,on h3h3 s podcast with mkbhd  marques said autopilot saved him from getting reared a few times  the sensors detected someone about to drive into him and the car jolted him forward a bit to save him from harm  i think that answers your question about unpredictability  unless you meant whilst driving too  in that case  i think it just maintains distance to ensure nothing could go wrong ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4531,you should be more afraid of yourself,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4532,there was a guy that was arrested for a dui in a tesla and he claimed the car was auto pilot and it was chill  the fun fact  the car felt the driver not correctly seated and something wrong and the car stopped on a bridge with hazard lights on  the auto pilot prevented him from maybe dying and also hurting others  we all have flaws like a car does  but in due time it will surpass our common sense  this is both fear and good ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4534,albert kocharyan  that was incredibly ignorant to say  you realize that he gets thousands of comments per video  and that s not even counting his other social media  do you think he had time to go through each one  no  he doesn t  it s not about being cool ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4535,as of right now  people need to understand that auto pilot on tesla is just a driving aid  you still need to focus on the road and it is still necessary to have your hands on the wheel  hence the car will warn you if it doesn t feel user response and if it doesn t find continuous response from you  auto pilot will be disabled  i myself will be using auto pilot as southern california traffic is not forgiving and hoping this will be a breeze in stop and go traffic ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4536,se7en not totally correct  there has been one  joshua brown  but even in this case he was apparently warned 7 times to keep his hands on the wheel and ignored it  so ai driving is looking pretty great so far and will only get better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4537,the statistics of death ratio factor in reckless drivers  what you should be looking at is your own past accidents and compare it to auto pilot  which will be different depending on the person ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4557,i wonder how practical a tesla becomes below freezing temperature  what if  one morning  the handles or charging lid freeze in place  and i wonder how useful the screen is if i would like to drive with gloves  sounds like a perfect car for  i imagine  sunny cali weather  but might be quite tricky in areas which hit  1  c  i am sorry to say this  but i think you were a bit to biased in this review  did not seem like you were reviewing this like you review other things ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4647,were you into cars before tesla or did you just bandwagon on the car specs like 0 60 quarter mile only cuz of tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4648,the reason i say that is as much as i love tesla and their cars  but no matter how much i care about quarter mile and 0 60s the fact is tesla cars are not fun to drive  i have driven in p100d model s and x  what makes driving fun well one aspect is the sound i love the engine sound the feel the vibrations it all adds to the experience  you should try to see if you can get your hands on the porche gt2rs my favorite car currently i bet even though it is  slower  0 60 times but i bet it is a blast to drive and you will probably see the benefits,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4768,i like you videos very much but it is clear that you are very biased  it is nice to see that you like this car so much but if you want to produce more car reviews i sugest you to be a bit more objectiv in the future  furthermore i would like the review a bit more in dept but that is just my opinion  i hope i do not offend you because i am just a big fan who would like to see even better videos of you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4774,the front of the tesla model 3 looks a lot like the front of a porsche panamera ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4798,clever series name ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4799,great video  the model 3 i think has a poor instrument panel design  as a driver  you should not have to turn your head slightly to the right to see how fast your going  this will cause issues later  also  from what i have seen in other videos  this vehicle is way to heavy reliant on the touch screen  simple task should have a tactical button on the instrument panel  i see that this a new look  instrument panel  but some things in vehicles should not change ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4818,you have to think of the effort that went into the research  all the shots of the car driving by  the map animations  planning the dialogue ect  does not have to be in 8k to be good,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4819,dogbeef needed a stabilizer on da hill shots i am going to,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
4820,the exposure is all over the place   some shots overexposed with very harsh highlight clipping  and some shots exposed for the exterior when he is showing the interior screen   honestly i have a hard time believing this is the red camera at all ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4835,wow i was among the first 6 viewers  by the time i finished the video there were 10 461 views   i must say tesla makes the best car possible with the consumer in mind rather than focusing on profits  one of the great ideologies of the company   waiting to have a hand s on the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

4843,to be honest  they cost way too much  plus there is nothing really special about them in any category  note that tesla took number 1 in the most unreliable cars of 2017,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

5166,eddie l  rosado nieves how is it hype when it actually does wtf they say it does  where is the other all electric 35   60k dollar car with the range and features that can be compared to this one  exactly  there is none  so to say it is hype is stupid ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5167,lord quas lights wheels and windows do not count ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

5173,marq mac  you will grow out of the fad eventually ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5174,eddie l  rosado nieves a fad huh  such a fad that other car brands are trying to compete by building their own all electric cars that can compete with tesla at a time when the whole world is a lot more energy conscious  sure dude  remember that 2 years from now when their semi truck and their badass roadster come out and fuck up the whole automotive game and embarrass establishment companies who have had almost 100 years to innovate but chose not to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5175,marq mac  yup  a fad  once competitors come out with their own stuff that is better  you are about to forget about tesla and start jumping on them  i guarantee it  just like apple was ten years ago ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5176,eddie l  rosado nieves well by that logic it is not a fad  make up your damn mind  you are clearly just being obtuse for no reason because you are contradicting yourself now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5177,marq mac elaborate  then  because  like any another fad  this is about to go out of style  this dipshit really tells me i am contradicting myself and does not know what fad means  get your life in order ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
5178,eddie l  rosado nieves hey dumbass  calling something a fad implies that it is only going to be popular for a short time  you called this electric car and it is features  autonomous driving and zero emissions and technology  a fad  then proceeded to say that someone would come and make a better version of this car  which is a contradiction to your point of this direction of innovation being a fad  shut the hell up and stop hating  tesla is on a roll and the other greedy fuckers are not going to be able to compete with them  tesla beat them to the punch already  they even went as far as putting their engineering template out in the open for all to see to encourage competition ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
5179,marq mac  i am calling tesla a fad  you dipshit  you are irrelevant  now   ps   they said the same thing about apple ,[1 0 0 0 1 0]

5189,kasim hussain wow how did you find me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5190,maybe not autonomous  at least for now  but certainly better electric vehicles  toyota  bmw  mercedes  and pretty much all other car manufacturers  have far more experience building cars on a large scale than tesla does  i love tesla  but if the model 3 does not succeed in establishing tesla as the pioneer brand in electric vehicles for everyone  the future does not look good ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5191,audi mercedes and bmw do not have the network that tesla has  every tesla using autopilot sends data to tesla making it better and better each day   tesla has been doing this for quite some time so they are ahead of their competitors  also the biggest factor of tesla their lead is the fact that they focus fully on electric cars  unlike their competitors who cannot make the electric cars too good because they still have to sell an insane amount of ice cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5192,theconformist they do have more experience building cars but those are not electric   its a huge difference  there is no competitor that can produce the amount of batteries that tesla can  their future is bright,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5193,it is not as easy as you think  tesla has a massive headstart on autonomy research and data because they actually have tesla s on the street right now doing level 2 autopilot  that data is priceless and puts them ahead of competitors who are likely just having prototypes out on the streets right now  also none of these companies have put auto pilot or any autnomous feature into a car at the 30 to 50 000 dollar price point like tesla has  i think it will be another decade  before those companies come up with an quivilent ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

5677,when you said it makes you feel like a fighter pilot  it reminded me of vector aeromotive s early models  if you ever find one of those rare amazing cars and get to drive it  it would be great to see your reaction to the interior styling and features ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5678,the car looks and sound nice but other then that lacks in modern design  even my 2018 has all this tech and more including space for drivers and touch screen  seems like the only thing you are really paying for is the name and maybe material  are you intentionally not addressing the lack of tech innovation in this car because touchscreen and auto connect is pretty standard in all cars these days ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

5741,what a weird video  it is called auto focus  but it has barely anything to do with the car  the video is mostly about apple carplay  which has been around for four years now  i did not learn anything from this video  and it was not even very enjoyable to watch and listen  as many others said  there is just something off about this entire thing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
5742,i wonder how people actually drive around in these cars and not worry that some jealous jerk is going to sneak up on it while you are gone  pull out his keys  and just scratch up the paint job   maybe their insurance covers everything  all i know is i would be super paranoid actually driving it and taking it out anywhere   certainly leaving it alone while i go do stuff ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

5842,i have never had issues with the built in ui or the navigation system etc  in any car of the past 10 years  so while i have used it once in a rental last year  i do not really see the big advantage of having apple car play  for all the rest t s just a learning curve and i find it always fun to go through  but that may just be a minority opinion because i like driving all kinds of different cars and never get too attached to a particular one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6027,this is the first video i have seen from this person  there is been so much hype on his work from everyone on the internet that i really expected to be blown away  plus your filming with red cameras and all   i think enough people have said what i also felt about the quality of this video  which is unfortunate because i probably will not come back to the channel after this introduction   i am curious why you hired cn to do your aerial work   he is not a very good drone pilot at all and to my knowledge does not have a 107 licence   i am not surprised he crashed the drone  he crashes them every video   is that why you hired him  for the  celebrity  value   if so that is unfortunate but a clear example of what is wrong with  youtubers  in general  they are hired and revered not for their technical skill as cinematographers or filmmakers  but for their personalities   oh  and i win the internet award for longest youtube comment ever    proper spelling not included ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6071,that  older lamborghini  is the most expensive one they ever made  it starts at around  2 5 million  but people have configured them to  3 million ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6072,nice,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6073,except that in brazil you do not get maps   oh the anger ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6074,wish this was 60fps,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6075,thumbs up if you came here from casey and thought this was the most underwhelming lambo video you have ver seen,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6076,it does not show up on the apple website since carplay is an optional paid feature for the aventador s  as for the centanario that was mentioned on the apple website  it gets carplay as standard  nice video  peace ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6077,apple car play is just as good in my 2018 chevy malibu   revs engine and pulls off  lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6078,give it a break he is starting out his first videos were neither perfect compared to that this is a very good start,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6079,you did not need a lambo  chevrolet vehicles do it really well with fraction of the cost,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6080,haha  nice to see a screen without a notch on it  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6081,this is starting to become a bit too far on the  first world privileges  and it just seemed entirely over the top and just for the flash of the vehicle when this review could have just as easily been done in any other car with apple carplay at much higher quality of a first impressions review and episode  the lamborghini is cool  however  it somewhat took away from  what interested you about this vehicle in the first place  i question whether this channel is heading towards a  unreasonably high priced luxury products that no one can afford  reviews  or whether it is still about the more reasonable technology that people can actually afford   of course  people may agree or disagree  i am open to hear what everyone has to say about this  but i did feel a bit uncomfortable and even a bit guilty for watching this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6082,this video is very random  weird and un necessary  he fixed on later  the thing is people like him  they start from bottom reviewing small stuff as they themselves are very close to average  but as they gain money  they get connections with higher class people  people who have more money  power  and slowly just  they feel what features or accessiblity they have  it can be accessed by everyone  so they review what is close to them like he can buy iphone so he use iphone  he will not go back and use nokia which most of people do use  average after samsung and huawei  for that  you must go to mr  mobile,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6083, no one can afford  speak for yourself  either stay in middle class or just shut the fuck up and level higher ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
6084, gordonfreeman5689 you 100  sound like a pretentious snob  money doesn t make you better than anyone  friend  edit  nice way to comment on a 3 year old comment by the way  i have a very different opinion about this now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6085,  dvn s 0069 a nice way to throw in ad hominem lol  never said money makes you better  in fact you also built me a straw man by saying  money does not make you better  friend  i have met people with money who are total assholes and literally have no brains  by calling me  a pretentious snob  i can already see what your  very different opinion  is now  i comment on all comments even if they are 10 year old comments  i will not write anything anymore  since you are like the type of people i have already met hundreds of times on social media and real life  anyways  have a great day  p s  you wrote that pretty emotionally did not you  next time  try better  but think with the brain and not the heart ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6086, gordonfreeman5689 not really  you are way overthinking this man       you replied to a 3 year old comment telling me to shut the fuck up  i think a little ad hominem was justified lmao,[1 0 1 0 0 0]

6089,it was kind of disappointing  i have felt that it is not even a car review and neither an apple carplay video  i really love all of your videos  almost everything about them  and well  i suppose that sometimes it is not easy for any reason to keep always the quality that your videos have  but i think that people that clicked on this video  even me  did not expect that this would be a carplay review  anyway  you are my favourite youtuber  because you are fucking great  and as a wish  come someday to barcelona ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6271,as a car guy and a tech head  thank you for being open with your learning experience shooting this video  you help illustrate how diverse videography can be  and just because someone can shoot great tech videos does not mean they can nail a car video without practice and experience  mkbhd veterans might be quick to point out choppy edits  awkward b roll  un synced audio  but it is worth remembering that we all learn by doing  and i am happy to see the results of what you learned  keep it up  looking forward to auto focus ep  3 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6310,i am sure that the auto reviews will get better   with the same kind of research done with other tech   i will agree that the location sucked  audio of the car shot from a truck bead  not so good  sorry   you normal production is above normal  i would have expected a top quality after seeing casey s video  by the way  love casey  but even the aerial shots were weak     i would think that manufacture would expect more review not only of the tech  but also the package it is in  the positive is finally someone  you  are reviewing the tech in vehicles  it is applications functions that the rev noise  tire smoke vlogers are passing over  by know means stop doing auto reviews  you will get it more then right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6316,work on the production of these  they are kind of all over the place  start with your mkbhd intro then introduce the vehicle with a cinematic sequence showcasing the entire vehicle  then switch to the shots of you inside to explain the interface and usability  then your personnel experience with the car  you have everything all there  it just needs some restructuring to make the viewer more interested  overall great start to a new series but remember this is not an in studio video so the style of how its done should be unique ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6317,just let the guy breath  stop all of the judging please,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6318,that guy right there no judgement just constructive criticism  which is exactly what they re looking for so they can improve the viewer experience  if you knew anything about video production or drawing an audience you d understand that there s always room for improvement  habe a good one and don t judge people s youtube comments   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6380,a half a mill for a car so noisy you cannot enjoy your apple music in anyway  plus you pollute the sound environment of people for half a block around  he called it the opposite of a tesla  and there is something to that  you can have this toy for macho men with too much money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6389,so  is google maps supported  if it is only apple maps then that is a disqualifier on its own  i waited to download that ios update for months when google maps was no longer supported and apple maps was truly a horrible piece of crap  maybe it is gotten better  i am not about to give it another chance ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6390,for the most part apple maps gets the job done  the main thing it lacks is just information  it is easier to enter in an adress rather than search by name  lane guidance and navigation is actually pretty good  and in terms of display  how it tilt s the screen near corners and on straights  much more intuitive at knowing just how long you have until the next turn  the main thing to remember  is carplay is not a google maps compeitor  its against the onboard nav on your car  and i would honeslty take carplay 100 times over for most cars than car manufacturer navigation  unless you bought an audi and have gmapps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6401,the biggest problem with carplay is that apple has not  and probably never will  allowed third party mapping apps  apple maps has come a long way  but there is no way i am making that my primary over waze  until if that ever changes  carplay is a gimmick at best  android auto has much more potential however ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6479,i did not feel this,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6480,i m a into both tech and cars big style  and your speciality is definitely with smartphones  you could tell this was rushed  the audio didn t look to sync with the car believably  i know it was recorded separately  lack of location and detail about the actually amazing features that this is a supercar  why did you look at car play for the whole video  you can tell you re either not really into cars  which is doubt because i thought you were  or you were just reading the specs off a list website with no actual meaning  did you even open the hood and look at the engine   if you focus a bit more on the mechanics and go into more detail it could definitely be great  check out shmee150  sam from seen thru glass  and a few other popular british car channels and i m sure you ll get a good idea of the sort of content makes a good car video  jay leno  drive tribe  the smoking tyre  and the straight pipes make great videos too  ultimately though you should make videos you want to make  just sharing my opinion  don t let us stop you from doing autofocus if you enjoy it  i would love to see you get better,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6623, shut up ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
6624,apple always being late to the party   i have a way cooler setup then this   having a full android car stereo  with all apps including youtube tv and netflix  also allows mirror cast and so much more    i laughed so hard at this video and is not what i expected from the biggest tech reviewer on youtube   but hey at least they got a cheap flight to florida and got to drive an ugly overpriced  supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6625,the added sound effects of the car were really unecessary  they kind of ruined the video  sorry ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6626,this entire video felt awkward and disingenuous  i understand that you probably got an opportunity to drive this nice car and you were excited but it just seemed like a cash grab that you just want to show off the car on this tech channel  you do not need to have this top of the line car in your videos for you to show us apple carplay or android auto  those services have been out for years and i have never seen you talk about them why on this car  it would make way more sense for you to show viewers that you can just go out an buy a radio that already has apple carplay or android auto and there are are so many great radios that have all of the features of this car  i install systems in cars everyday that is why i feel so strongly about this  i love your videos and have been watching for so many years now  keep up the good work man and stay true to you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6631,what the fuck are you talking about  if you drove a lambo it would be all over you instagram  snapchat and all of your friends would know you fuck,[1 0 1 0 1 0]
6632,no  sorry  totally disagree  you really think mkbhd is someone who wants to showoff  you clearly have not watched these videos long enough to see the kind of person he is  marques has said in the past he wants to expand a little bit with automotive videography  and this was an excellent opportunity to do that  while highlighting new technology  he did a fantastic job explaining the carplay first for those who just wanted to learn about that  and wrapped up nicely with a little overview on the car  marques if you read this  i hope you continue making tech videos that incorporate automobiles  this was great ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6633,lmao shut the fuck up,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
6634,think you guys are missing the point  its about the fact that this is not new tech at all but he is acting like this video is about the apple carplay  i do not need to watch mkbhd to see a lamborghini there are plenty of places to do that or even go drive one around a track  i am happy that he got the opportunity to have fun but this looks like a sign of letting companies woo him  he seemed especially against things like this in his h3h3 interview   so again i say  mkb if you ever see these comments i am happy for you that you got this opportunity  stay true to you  and keep up the great work ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6635,sure  he could have done the video in a chevy impala with a carplay radio  but this was available  and it is more exciting to watch  it did not detract from the video purpose  so why complain ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6636,i think it was the no music that made it akward,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6637,dam  you guys sure judge a lot,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6638,i agree  he seems stiff and not in his normal groove  i think it s just a matter of confidence  new series  new car he s probably never driven before so that s a lot to be thrown at you all at once and not look stiff  i love mkbhds content  been following for about 5 years now and will continue to do so  this will be a huge hit once he s gained more confidence,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6872,hey marques  just some constructive criticism  i know you probably will not see this  but this is definitely not one of the better quality videos you have put out  here is what i think went wrong    audio levels were all over the place  what happened  you are usually strict with maintaining the same levels in your videos but this one got to the point where it was distracting  constantly having to change the volume on my device depending on the scene    fake mismatched car sounds  what is with that  i am not sure if i am in the minority of your subs but i watch a lot of car videos on youtube and the best parts are usually when i get to hear how a car sounds  it took less than a second for me to realise that the shots of the car and the sounds i heard  were not correct    fake visuals  correct me if i am wrong but it looked like some of the apple car play shots on the screen inside the car were overlayed in post  this is pretty easy to tell  it does not work in movies tv shows and it does not work here    story  i can appreciate the attempt at trying to tell a story but using b roll footage to  move to another location  then just show the exact same shot of inside the car did not really work  lastly  there were a couple of shots you used multiple times  i have never seen you do this before and it is a pretty amateur thing to do ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6915,i feel like we are being to tough on this video  while i agree with everyone on the subpart layout and content quality of this video we have to remember he is a tech youtuber and is not a car youtuber  we cannot hold his video to the same standard as other car reviews because obviously it was not a car review  i am sure he will learn from his mistakes here and make the next car vid even better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6939,probably this video should not have been released  i see that it is probably one of your first car videos but the irony of testing out car play in a lambo just did not came out and in a car perspektiv way smaller channels do way better those driving shots were made it the wrong locations nobody cared about lightning sound did not match up bad storyline and the potential you took out of your 50k camera was just not there but i see it was one of your firsts also caseys production company seriously has to step up their game ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

6988,luis barbosa why exactly is one not allowed to critique another person s creative work  i have never filmed a review before but why does that disqualify a person from recognizing when something has potentially missed the mark  have you never watched any movie  or listened to any song and thought to yourself this was not as good as it could have been  marques is a top notch creator here on yt and for his level of standards it just looked like this video missed the mark is all this guy is trying to say ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6989,itachii267 bro  do not enable this armchair quarterback  people need to be called out for trashing something a creator spent time on for our enjoyment  for free  damn  people  ungrateful much ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
6990,while i do not agree with the way it was said by the original poster i do feel like the video missed the mark in quality  indeed though you are right in that we get this stuff for free so what is their to complain about right  well i would posit that as fans of marques that we have a right  respectfully mind you  to let him know if something feels off  would that be a better way of going about it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7010,i thought of this too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7011,casey s cinematography is not even good  he just has a lot of subscribers so his gaga fans and kiss ass associates feed his ego  that drone footage was pixelated and had an ugly color profile  peter mckinnon though has created breathtaking b roll  i am guessing marques did not want to pass up the chance to work with casey neistat but this video suffered for that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7012,we do not need blackbar png,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7013,guys casey is a great photographer  the clips he took in this video where not pixelated  they looked perfect  they matched the tone of the whole video  casey is known for transforming ordinary shots into great works through editing  the shots he took were very high resolution and if they were that bad  he would not have had such a huge audience and would not be appointed for a lamborghini video  there s a reason he participated in filming a  500 000 car  and it s not because lamborghini and marquez are just blind followers  it s because he does some incredible work ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7014,love casey and peter but since when is peter known for drone work   b roll  yes peter is more cinematic than casey even casey acknowledges that but casey was not invited for b roll  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7015,bizygi casey definitely is not a cinematographer he is an editor  he is a master of story telling through editing and angles ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7016,i thought the drone shots were some of the better ones in the video  a lot of the others had weird pans and composition  and were shaky  they shot this on a cloudy day  which is honestly terrible for a video like this  i doubt casey color corrected his footage so that it would be consistent throughout the video  also  the location seemed terrible for a car video  not enough aerial footage was used  what drone stuff was there was  cut in at weird times  and there is no music  the drone footage is not the problem with this video ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7017,love that you made this video with casey neistat  sorry about the drone lol  great video  love the review  it need android however lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7018,i do not get the premise of this video carplay has been around for a while now  and most everyone has at least seen it   many people already have it in their regular cars   so why review it and introduce it as if it is a fresh new feature we have never seen   especially to your tech savvy audience  maybe because you own a tesla you are not aware of carplay s prevalence   this just feels almost insulting  and the video definitely does not feel cohesive or make much sense to me   sorry  i know you put a lot of work into it  but this was just a miss ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7093,roehit kadam the first video i am disliking in a long long time  this was rushed  i love his work  but he could have definitely done better especially with 100k in cameras that he has ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7094,renzy trinidad that is a horrible comment  disliking a video for poor quality is a primary function of the dislike button  it provides valuable feedback to the content creator ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7095,i would agree  i think it is partially not having the knowledge on how to shoot cars  there are a lot skills to shooting effective car shots and it may just take a while to learn ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7097,i agree  i was thinking the same thing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7098,the exhaust notes being out of sync a lot with the car s movements and also the lack of real engagement with the car did not help  and the mic audio did not sound the best  i have seen much better mkbhd vids,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7134,watchable but not mkbhd standard ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7135,this video was not worth it  i do not think he will get enough ad money to pay for the cars he rented  and when he crashed casey s drone,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7136,yeah  the centenario is just an older lamborghini  you keep thinking that  bud  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7137,it could be amazing  i was expecting a lot from you the way you shot the video but it was not good  maybe you rush the editing part because it could be a lot better as you have had amazing shots ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7138,marques  i love your style of videos but this one seems off of what your usual style is it was a little boring  i feel like it was missing that background music ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7139,although the video looked great  the audio syncing needs a lot of work  i d recommend watching krispy media as he is the best in the car filming game today ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7140,i thought you weren t into  gasoline machines  bro    thanks for gettin  real with us ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7141,one thing that you got wrong is that carplay is a wildly new and uncommon feature  a large majority of cars are getting carplay standard  or it is available with the first trim above base model ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7142,they should make ways compatible,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7143,that intro,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7150,great video  everyone bashing could not have done better anyway  i will say it was probably tough to do with a lambo  do not want to mess with a lambo that is not yours  the drone scenes were   casey,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7160,so a half million car with apple carplay support does not have a touch screen  using the phone screen directly while mounted somewhere seems way more convenient i am going to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7161,video ideal   make a dear elon  tesla wishlist video possibly with some of these wishlist items  since he seems to like you    1 heads up display 2  led trim inside interior 3 apple car play 4  ticket avoidance 5  parking finder without being in car  6 tesla logo illuminated  front and back 7  extended sun visor   and whatever else you want to add    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7162,i was very excited to see this video   specially after casey s vlog  but the video was straight out disappointing  editing was poor,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7164,cars are only cool until you realize you can get way more acceleration and adrenaline pumping feel of power on a motorcycle  and for waaaay cheaper  brand new harley softail will do 0 60 in 4 5 seconds or less  for 20 grand  you should get into some bikes if you really want to feel that throttle response ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7186,it is very  very rare i dislike a video  especially yours  as a car enthusiast  this was an absolute disgrace to the car and what it was built for  you did not even rev it properly or sync the sound for crying out loud  since you were changing locations so much  you could have atleast demonstrated what carplay can do while you were driving the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7394,i enjoy your style  your gadget reviews are awesome  but  in personal opinion   the overall delivery of this episode was kind of clunky   and production value   well   we  the audience  are kind of spoiled and expect the lambo to go with posh background  kind of did  minus the other cars  but the construction parts   could cut out  changes in the locations   i get the idea and it is great   but in the edit  the rhythm did not really work   i love the idea of tech and car series  check out the british  top gear  series   just to measure the pulse and manage expectations   until the end  i was surprised that there was no test of the android system  now i know why  keep it up ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7459,have to say this is probably the most boring video of an aventador i have ever seen  such slow driving  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7460,i am a cow and i love it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7461,marques you are clearly out of your comfort zone on this video but it is nice to see you trying out new things  i guess you got to start somewhere  hate to say this but casey actually did a better job of show casing the car in his video and he was only doing behind the scenes  the slow moving car shot with engine reviving was absolutely awful to watch  who wants to see an aventador doing 10kph while being revved out    i should point out i am a petrol head and am spoiled from years of watching the worlds best car shows ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7462,not going to lie  i do not really like you reviewing cars or car tech when you seem to know so little about it  i mean i get that your audience are not necessarily car people but still  for a second car video this is fine  and i know there is a big push from the auto industry to get more tech reviews out there for their mainstream brands even if the tech journalists do not regularly know much of what they are talking about  but  now it is going to be awkward to review a normal vw golf gti with better infotainment that a lambo  cannot really say i understand the direction of this series  it seems like fast toys instead of serious consumer tech  the latter being the thing nearly all of your subs are here for with the vast majority being interested in the most important tech purchase they make  by all means go and have fun making those videos  but really you should have fun driving the cars and using them rather than just filming it from the outside   i know this is supposedly about apple car play  but that is the same sat nav that is in millions of dull audis  and the interface even looks considerably older than that of most of the newer audis  why it does not even have mirror link as a vw group car is bizarre   there is no real depth into the use of apple car play maps  the app comparison  it is traffic functionality and updating compared to what is already in the lamborghini etc  what consumer value did we just gain   2018 aventador s are supposed to have android auto out of the factory  no idea what is going on there though  so maybe that comparison was the main aim of this video and lamborghini just buggered that up for you  edit  i think it may have something to do with lamborghini and google doing the years differently  normally an updated car released in the last quarter of 2018 would be named a 2019  so it is likely the  2019  aventador s  which will probably be available by october november will have android auto  it is just that all google press releases say 2018  you tested the car that is been available since 2017   presumably you are going to be visiting phoenix and waymo as part of this series right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7488,i expect some peter mckinnon b roll you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7489,same thoughts here mate  exactly as you have put it  all those cool shots of the car were not mkbhd quality somehow  and there was no music  just the raw audio from the video files  dafuq   d,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7490,same thing i thought  the mkbhd quality just was not there apart from the visuals which did not really add all that much,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7491,i think he was going to compare android auto and apple car play  then after flying to florida  getting the car  realized it did not have android auto  had to be a bummer lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7492, morgan mccormick probably true but the mkbhd i know would have just found another car with android auto to showcase  it is not that hard  assuming a comparison is what he wanted to do in the first place  if this was an ad for carplay or lambo it was bad for both of them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7493,could have had some music with footage but with the roar sound of the engine  that would have been dope  it just looked like cooked food but forgot to add the seasoning or salt   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7494,same quality as casy,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7495,the audio of the car was lame  there was flyby type audio when the car was clearly just cruising ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7502,we are all spoiled by top gear production quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7503,nightvision110 but that is irrelevant  the main issue is the audio not the video component  i thought it would have been better if he recorded the car audio from inside the car  as i am sure they would not let him mount a mic to the rear of the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7504,exactly  because grear cannot make you a great producer,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7505,nightvision110 but from epsd 1 and the tesla ad  and knowing how much of a quick learner marques is and add the fact that he has a team now  it should have been at the least a step better than the tesla one   which was in itself 4   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7523,yea  i get that it looks nice on the outside  but on the inside it is so bad design and even worse   poor tech  designed by old men for old men  i would rather have a mess of a design on the outside  if the inside actually was beautiful  user friendly  and something that looked like 2018  since this is a channel for people with tech as an interest  this is probably the last thing i want to see  unless you actually show me how they make the car  which is probably very interesting  and last  apple car play review is missing is not it  to me it looked very bad   why no conclusion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7537,this video was   meh  it really felt like you were out of your comfort zone  that is great  we should never get stuck into it  but everything seemed bland  you cannot just drive a lambo in neighbourhood roads  maybe shoot in a sunnier day and do not record those revs sounds straight from the pipes     critics aside  love your work ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7615,very useful information  really thank you marques  i was hesitant between mazda 3 and the lambo  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7616,not one of the best videos  the sound is  off queue  nearly all the time  there are some repetitive shots and the overall quality of the b roll shots is lesser the usual  it is still higher than most other channels  however for mkbhd levels  this does not really do ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7617,the b roll had me cringing  also shots of you driving are way too fake sounding and too wimpy  you are reviewing a lambo ffs  step on the gas a bit  also the whole storytelling part of the video was not good  apple carplay should have been a minor part of the video  it is really not that interesting of a thing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7624,great vid marques  but there are some things that bother me  it feels like at this point and for a show this expensive to make  you really should have moved past the jump cut and using shaky footage  either do another take or get some b roll footage to cover up those cuts  also  the structural editing seemed a bit weird  going between car footage and sections of the carplay review  it felt a little unstructured  just wanted to give some constructive feedback  i really like this series ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7684,mrfas97 ferrari fxx  k  has about 1k hp  lambo cent  has about 700  its not about the horses  its more about everything combined  like aerodynamics  steering  transmission  gears  etc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7685, stop fighting  in my comment ffs i am getting too many notifications now  also  being a  road car  means road legal and the centenario just like the la ferrari can drive on roads as far as i know  most people buy these cars just to drive around or show off their money  track focused means road illegal and simply built to race  that is where the fxx comes in as well as the sesto elemento or aventador sv  people buy these cars to actually drive them on tracks and not to show off since they are not that comfortable to sit in anyway ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7686,emmanuel ba ales prieto i know a lot about cars and the centenario does not compete with anything near the ferrari fxxk  fxxk only has one competitor and it is the mclaren p1 gtr,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7687,waffles4ev3r i am a car enthusiast too  and no the p1 gtr is not the only competitor,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7701,lmfao the centenario is a aventador with a custom body kit  same chassis etc  the laferrari is a completely different beast with variable length intake tracks in it is v12 engine  the laferrari literally has engine tech that is banned in formula 1  whist the lambo has the same engine with barely any improvements  although the lambo does look crazy and performance is not everything ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

7865,marques  i am a huge fan but i did not feel like this video was up to par to your usual standard  audio quality varied from scene to scene  i hated the screen capture that highlighted elements  and i felt like the shots visual story could have been a lot stronger  in particular  transitioning from the parking garage to the various locations  feel like this may have been a rushed project or outsourced to a different editor ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7866,casey neinstat did a lot of the aerial shots but if you look at his twitter he said that this video was much harder and more work than he anticipated  and that he learned a lot from it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
7867,yeah i have the same feeling  overall i love the new series  i know it is much harder to film outdoors in motion but sometimes taking more time to shoot and reshoot scenes will give you better quality  in example 1st shot with car entrance could be redone b c there is this awkward moment when mkbhd disappears behind suicide door  next shot with inside talk you can see someone just randomly walking behind car not to mention such a bad audio mix with random rev sounds  looking forward to the next project  keep it up  mkbhd,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

8054,why does nobody notice the missing article in the title ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8055,good that it was a tech video  as a car video it was bad  car noise was all over the place  not matching what the car was doing  this engine running noise while you sit in the car was very annoying  first scene where you sit in the car   someone is walking around behind you  transition shots were not smooth at all  overall bad car presentation but good carplay demo ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

8216,yeah  as far as software goes  no company has yet to harness the exotic vehicle market  apple carplay reacts exactly the same in a  500k lambo as it does in a  40k f 150 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8217,got to say not that great a video   it felt   off  you could tell that its was not a smooth project it felt like you guys were not in your comfort zone  plus those rev sounds were straight up bad  you could tell that you guys straight recorded the lambo revving in stationary on neutral and added that in and it sounded horrible    audio editing overall during the actual segment  excluding some of the commentary or the intro  was pretty abysmal overall to be honest  p s not hating i know they must have had their limitations and they will surely improve upon their shortcomings from this one  if i had to put it in a word this video did not feel  as  crispy  as the usual mkbhd vid ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8218,axe2595 totally agree  felt meh ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8219,same  did not hit the mkbhd level of cinematography we used to know ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8220,i definitely felt the limitations in the video  the carplay and inside shots look good but it s missing the drama and fluidity that getting and filming a car like this should have contained  where s the crazy music with a gap for an engine rev  where s the happy faces whilst driving it  where s the publics reaction ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8221,i thought they just put it in neutral and reved it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8222,i love mkbhd s videos  but he are not jeremy clarkson i will say that much  i can just imagine the grand tour crew watching this and wincing at a lot of the language used to describe the car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8223,he s obviously gathering experience about this segment of video making   i could feel the video was off as well and it s clear that the video is not about carplay at all  but about marques wanting to mess around with car video making   give the guy some time and he ll surprise us eventually  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
8224,it was time limit he only got it for a day and a half so cannot blame him,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

8687,not sure why you were so hyped about this bro when you can through a 7  android tablet in any car with double din sockets and have the full power of android in your car  put your phone on hotspot when you get in  maybe someone sneaky can add a nfc tap command in ifttt for where you normally sit your phone  and you got google maps and the rest of the gang of apps  if you are not keen on hacking and modding your car  on ebay aliexpress you can now boy regular android tablet built into the normal car double din shroud so you just install it like a new radio without cutting up your dash or something ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

8964,actually this is the first video from mhbhd which i feel is not that great  everyone knows lambo just sells cars by the looks  even you know that your model s can beat it in a drag race like a piece of cake  and fact that reviewing a feature like apple carplay on a car that has a minimum userbase is nothing  i feel you did this just because they sent it to you and you really look underwhelmed  let us know about the next generation rather than a tractor company car who prefer making noises ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

8969,yeah tesla may have the best marketing of all car companies but that does not make their cars great  most of them look srsly crappy  like they should fire the entire design team and take people from audi bmw mercedes porsche   those cars look aggressive  the tesla rather look like some shitty toyota or so  and roadster is not even released if that counts you can also compare it to an audi vision gt  p and by the way the pixel 6 is way better than iphone 8  and i do not care if it does not exist yet ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9037,love the video you obviously have a ton of talent but one suggestion would be to get the real audio of a car when it is accelerating by or on the driving shots instead of recording the exhaust later and dubbing it in  it is pretty obvious to car guys and quite frankly that is your main audience with this series probably,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9054,adam no guess what  he is not going to stick to the studio  he is going to branch out into other fields he loves  improve himself and succeed in them  you guys expect 500  delivery every time as if you are paying a dime  damn,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9055,paul oomel i have come to expect 500  because of his standards  which he set himself  this should be nothing more than an experiment which he learns from ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9056,i agreed with your opinions  but i guess the reason why the whole videos seem so awkward could be of limitations and restrictions he faced as the car does not belong to him  he had limited time to test for the best shots  also as probably could tell he is not allowed to drive the car  you can see the behind the scenes from casey neistat  lastly  it was filmed in a neighborhood which gave more restrictions to shows the car potential  the video just seem like a compilation of whatever he managed to film from the site and explained it forcefully  but still appreciate new content  wish him the best ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9354,you,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9355,i know i am going to get bashed for saying this  but the car b roll in this video was one of marques s weakest i have seen  it did not look good at all  and the sound editing did not help  it was like the audio was not coming from the car at that same time  the content was kind of lame  just briefly showing car play and that is pretty much it  this was not a good video  it was not up to mkbhd s standards  i still love marques  still love the channel just have to admit when something is not good,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9356,i agree  it felt like the b roll was shot on an iphone and was not even edited  looks gray and is shaky  and not even any music in the background  hopefully he will learn from this video and create better content in the future though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9357,the audio was recorded separately  i do not know why he chose to make it this way  first video i am disappointed with,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9358,i agree  i had huge expectations looking at the bts  it s the sounds that threw me off the most though  the audio didn t match the cars speed and movement ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9359,definitely  it is like he wanted to make it seem like he was going faster than he was or something  i do not know ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9368,nigel canning casey only shot the air cinematography  marquees and his team shot the most of the video  and edited of course  do not get me wrong i am a huge fan of mkbhd but i am kind of disappointed in this video,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9437,i do not know why but i find this video a little boring  the shots were not used properly  that feel good factor was missing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9438,the production quality of this channel is insane ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9439,damn that was the very first video of you i am disappointed with  not from the contents itself  but this video has no structure whatsoever and feels cut very very strangely  there is no real conclusion and everything feels like a gimmick without an actual purpose for the video  very strange experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9440,abisz007007 you are right  i was so focused on the amazing video quality  on how it looks like a movie  that i did not even notice that there is no real point of the video ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9441,yeah  lots of odd cuts  no music in the background  video felt off from his normal quality  i stopped watching halfway through ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9442,yup  one of the most boring video from him,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9443,he was trying something different  i would not mind another car tech video  the one with the weird motorized camera dollies was super cool ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9448,abisz007007 give the guy a break  it is pretty obvious this is not his niche but he keeps doing his best  what are you good at  and have you ever tried doing something different and perfected it as soon as you embarked on it  i say we give him time  shooting indoors in a controlled environment is quite different than shooting outdoors     ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9449,so confusing,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9450,maxmillian urio the problem is not that it is a new ground for them  marques videos are on a level where you have to compare them to a movie  with a story arch  character development and a 3 act story  only that his characters are himself and his gadgets  in this video all of this is missing  for example  why are we changing locations   he could have said   here is a picture of a carrot cake for the next 20sek  from a pure story standpoint it would have made similar sense  we gain no insight into anything by the change of location  besides fancy looking pictures of the lambo  plus  we do not actually change locations there are no wide shots establishing the different locations and it cuts so randomly between different shots  that we have no spacial avarness whatsoever ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9451,your future roadster is probably going to smoke that for half the price lol  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9454,nothing will ever beat the mesmerizing sound of an engine when you floor it especially in cars like these  no electric car will ever be able to recreate that,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9559,carsound is amazing but does not fit with the video    great video anyway  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9560,thia video is so weird  first  the sound so very off  like  it is incredible inconsistent  it is quite bad at the end  and the shots of car just seemed  very boring and useless  like  are you reviewing the car  the apple car software  what was the focus here  maybe i am alone here but this video just seemed really slapped together with no real goal and just a lot of filler  honestly  it seemed like a lame click bait  like  look at this car everyone says looks cool and is expensive so people want to see a video with it  i do not think there was much thought put into this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9561,qphr   john cano   make a better video then ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9562,qphr   john cano because he probably was not driving fast,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
9563,qphr   john cano it sucks when lazy ass suckers like you write paragraphs to criticize the work of others  of which you are paying 0  for  he did not force you to watch it  so if you dislike it  or have difficulty understand it gtfo  what is the harm in reviewing the apple app  making a brief review of the car and adding some cool drive through scene ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
9564, you critique a game because you like a game and you want the game to be better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

9932,coming back and watching all these again  this one stands out because i really do not agree on your definition of  supercar  a supercar does not  need  to make any tradeoffs whatsoever to be a supercar  it just needs to be faster around a track than virtually all other cars  below  it is class when all are stock  you absolutely  can  have your cake and eat it too with a supercar  it is just that doing so is  really  really  hard due to physics and so i would argue that the most impressive supercars are the most  liveable  ones  and they usually have the pricetag to boot  that need to beat almost all cars in the lower  tier  is also what sets hypercars apart from the crowd  they need to be that much faster that there is  barely  any room at all for it to be  liveable  now  and again i would argue that the most liveable ones in that category are by far the most impressive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

10091,i think this video is flawed for multiple reasons and the number one reason is if you or anybody you know buys a supercar they have money to afford  multiple cars  most people don t buy super cars as dailies  and i think that what he says at the start of the video where he says i reviews cars and  take them on a drive and give them back is what most people do if they  have a super car they take them on the highway  they go to tracks and have fun  and of course they wouldn t be practical and many of the points he makes are obvious like everything being at arms length and that s why i believe this video doesn t really make sense,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

10230,sorry   but it seems so obvious that he is not  one of this car guys  1  i would say  mostly you should  earn  a supercar  take first of all a sportscar  which which is focused on the driving experience  before you bring out the big kahunas  i am thinking of a supra  or cayman or alpine  2  he had the car in automatic and did not really realized it  the nsx is shifting  when you want it to shift  it is not your automatic of your mums suv  also  total wired position of the hands on the steering wheel  3  i mean   everyone who can afford a supercar should be able to buy one  do not get me wrong  but be careful and do not say that you are  those guys  probably you would keep it for most of the time in the garage and would have your first car   because of exactly those reasons  and these are even modern supercars  which have far less trade offs  low driving position  less forgiving suspension setting  limited trunk space and so on   for me as  medium crazy petrolhead  it is just so nauseating to see people  who are watching all these super car videos  and think  that they could be also  one of those  you know it   you do not  think  that you are one of those ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

10313,honest opinion  this video was just ok  as a car guy who also loves tech  this did not check off all of the stuff i would want to see on a car video  definitely not enough information on the cars specs  i want to hear what the compression ratio is  what the a r ratio of the turbos and what type of turbos they are  more info about how the computer controls the electric motors  etc  i do not really see anything that this series does that is not done as well or better on yt already  not trying to trash talk on this video  i have been watching mkbhd since the very begining  where hd videos on yt was a big deal that not many people were doing yet  and i admire marques branching off and doing more stuff  maybe just add some more motion graphics when you read off the specs and give just a little more car history in the begining  as well as comparing this car to others in the same class  i do like the length of the video  most car review videos are just way too long  peace man ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

10528, corymayley4879 my friend had a demon and the 0 60 times were not close to 2 3s  if you are going to try to get that kind of acceleration  you need a drag strip  drag slicks  a stripped out interior  skinny front tires  and most importantly a good driver  even with all of these things  it is going to be insanely hard to get a 2 3s 0 60   plus  who said it is all about acceleration  that demon cannot take a turn ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

10826,there are many reasons why you should never listen to a tech gadget nerd when he she talks about something out of their field of expertise  example  marques states that the nsx has a harsh ride  this is a non car guy  who names his f ing car lol  who drives a tesla model s  being a real car guy myself  someone who has driven the model s p100d many times and logged 3 1 2 hours on a solo nsx test drive  i can tell you that the dude does not know what he is talking about  or rather i should say he is comparing apples to oranges   my daily driver is a 1st gen audi r8 spyder  i have always driven nothing but sports cars or sporty cars  starting with the 2004 nissan 350z roadster and working my way up to higher end cars over the years  the model s is a cushy ride  the nsx is a cushy ride when rightfully compared to  other sports cars and supercars   if you drive sports cars  and then try the nsx  you will instantly realize that is the most daily drivable supercar in production  i had no intention of buying and nsx  my dealer friend allowed me the test drive and so i took it  as someone who knows and loves high performance sports cars and supercars  i was blown away by the nsx for a number of reasons  someone like marques who does not know nor appreciate these types of cars is going to have the same basic mild reaction that he displayed here    if you want to know about phones  watch marques  if you want to know about high performance cars  look elsewhere ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11733,or buy the nsx which is an amazing automobile built by a company who has been making cars for decades instead of 10 minutes  also  from your reaction  feels like you might like a tesla model x more so  the tesla roadster is going to have all the same caveats you mentioned about ride and visibility  the frunk might get you a tad more storage  but not much  of course  no sexy sound with those tesla s  but tesla people are not looking for that or anything about the joys of driving a car    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11803,hugppyz i was only making the point that honda would jump on the opportunity for some publicity  i think its a fine car as far as performance is concerned  i just do not like the interior exterior  heavy hybrid system  and  relative of course  low hp combustion engine  id take a 570s  r8 v10  or any porsche gt car over this  which are all in the same price range ish ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11804, evaluna122 the nsx is built in the usa not in china ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11805, grahamwilliams2494 exactly  that is what people do not get  the nsx has no business costing 180k even though it is a well engineered car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11806, chamade166 true petrol heads know these  tech nerds see hybrid and they like  little wonder the prius is successful  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11807,it is tragically underrated and misunderstood  to me it is extraordinary on every level  by all reasonable standards  it is unique  gorgeous from every angle  super quick  sophisticated  and built by a manufacturer that knows how to engineer exceptionally reliable cars  people also complain about the interior  but it looks fantastic to me  it is a tasteful  cohesive  practical  intuitive design that is aggressive  yet elegant  just like the exterior  just my opinion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11808,how good a car sells is not necessarily a measure for how good or bad a car is  the demand for sports cars is in decline currently  but it is also still only a couple years old  it is often the case that extraordinary  innovative things do not always catch on immediately  the nsx will eventually get more of the respect it truly deserves  i think ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11809, consciousrobot i think you might be a little too patronising there  the nsx is an all around great automobile but you cannot defend that interior  it is horrible compared to anything coming out of britain or germany  cheaper mercs  bmws and audis have interiors that are at least 5 years ahead of this car s  there is absolutely nothing elegant about that interior  it is too cheap ish for anything costing 100k  talk more of 180k  even their fellow japanese have much better interiors  look at the lexus rcf or nissan gtr  or the new supra interior  they make honda s efforts look lackluster  which  quite frankly  it is  the nsx might have an incredible power train and tech  but the interior simply does not play in that league  it is absolutely rubbish  the interior  combined with the price tag  and the fact that it cannot match a modern ferrari  are some of the reasons why this nsx is a flop  it is not a bad sports car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11810, chiefdenisi actually really like the interior  it looks good to me  that is just my opinion  i do not see anything wrong with it  maybe they could have used better power window buttons  but that is not a big deal to me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11817,not as fast as other  supercars  if you can even call it that  exaggerated price for what it is  audi r8  mercedes amg gt class  even a porsche 911 turbo are still cheaper and more luxurious  people who want a fast japanese coupe will just go for the gt r  rc f  lc 500  etc  all of which are much cheaper than the nsx as well  the only people who buy the new nsx are people with lots of money who are dead set on having one  and there are not many ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11837,of course it dose  the usa has made in mandatory to have back up cameras on every car that is new now  why put a ultra hd camera on a car that is already expensive to begin with and was not designed for it  its like saying on no cup holders in a supercar  the germans and italians also put garbage cams in just because they have to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11861,to be honest if i were to get a supercar  this would probably be it  i like the design especially because it is clearly a high end machine  but at the same time the look is not so overstated like some supercars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11862,my dude chris was nervous af  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11863,what about being stuck in traffic  i feel like any super   sports car will not do very well there  i love driving but i work night shift and skip almost all traffic and i can enjoy it  if i worked day shift i would probably use the public transport as the traffic would be insane  p s  you are getting good at this really fast ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11872,i am surprised there was not any dope drone shots on the track ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11873,hey mkbhd  do you think it is possible for tesla or other high end car manufacturers to use backup and other cameras on the car as a security measure  for example when a vehicle bumper sensor detects motion then the camera activates in that area  front or rear  and records for the user to see  would be pretty useful i think ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11883,ok  it was definitely an improvement over the last auto focus  but still needs more polishing  the audio feels still a bit weird and the car b roll was kind of boring and repetitive  liked the script a lot better on this one  keep them coming marques  want to see more ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11891,marques you are fucking awesome,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
11892,mkbhd  you are awesome at car reviews    i see more coming and you being successful at it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11893,yeah  make those trade offs  sweet track test  seen a couple of those new nsx cars while commuting  not sure what i think yet but you definitely added some good perspectives to consider ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11894,13 55  and the tires are getting warmer too  so they will get a little more slippery  i was always and under the impression its the opposite in that when you tires are cold they are slippers but gain more traction as they warm up ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11895,if tire warm to much then become slippery also,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11896,yup  there is a happy medium          i miss track days  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11897,depends on the compound of the tire  if they are street tires  they are less grippy when warm ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11898,yeah what the other guy said  if  you warm them a bit on the track they get stickier but too warm and they will start to lose all traction quickly hence why drifting and breakign tires loose under power in a track racing scenario is considered very bad technique  you want the tires warm not hot ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11899,that is why drag cars do burnouts to heat the tires for better grip,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11900,he probably meant that they will get harder as air expands when the temperature rises  the rubber may be getting more grip  but the tension increases which makes the rubber lose its grip again  it is actually quite bad  lowering the pressure after the tires heat up will solve this problem and give you more grip as you now have warm tires  rubber will be very sticky  and optimal pressure  more rubber touching the road and therefore again  very sticky ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11901,that is what she said,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11902,when they get to hot they become slippery like when ever a car slides or drifts the tires get to hot and become slippery of the hotter they get the more traction where the case then when ever a car went out of control it would ve stopped as soon as someone stepped on the brakes,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11903,while racing the heat is much more than normal and will make the tire slippery ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11904,some tires do get gripper when they heat up  others did not,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11905,not true your standard street tire,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11906,slippery it seems but better handling  grip and control,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11907,like imagine hard rubber vs soft rubber  the hard rubber is more jolty and firm whereas the soft rubber is more buffered and jelly like  more grip no doubt ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11908,no ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11909,some these guys here have got it right  some other do not lol  a tyre has a optimal temperature in which it has the best grip  too low or too high of that temp and it will be slippery well more slippery anyway  these tyres are also street tyres  they would be a higher performance tyre then say what a camry would come with but still street tyres  not fully designed for track use like a racing slick flat surface  tyre on most race cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11910,buy a jaguar f type svr  customize it and save money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
11911,not that i could afford a car like this but visually this car does not look appealing enough to me for the price   it looks really nice but more like a 50k car and not a near 200k car   even a new corvette looks more spicy to me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

11972,i cannot help but feel that many of the trade offs you mention will not apply to your roadster   the cockpit will have more space and there will be a frunk  virtues of the all electric platform   you also should not have to worry about your groceries pre cooking since there is no engine to heat them up   the only thing i can see carrying over is lack of ground clearance  but from what we have seen of the roadster so far  it did not look like it was dragging its belly on the ground   tesla may also utilize more of its titanium armor plating to protect the underside from damage ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12020,was it not obvious to you that that was a joke ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12021,a lot of tech reviewers are not car guys  and some of those are not  umm  athletic   mkb is a n0ob at the car thing  but he is athletic and willing to learn  which means he is ready to advance quickly on track in the hands of an instructor  as apparent in the video   big kudos to mkb for attempting this the right way  some youtubers are heading out to press events with fast cars on track with next to zero formal training and it shows in their reviews   that said  the non car guy techy viewpoint is a perfectly valid one for car reviews  mr mobile  etc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12022,i mean he sees it from a tech guy point of view  so there is that  he does not see it from a experienced car guy point of view  you got to take this in consideration criticisim him ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12029,i m both a car and a tech guy and the reviews are completely different  overall this wasn t really a great review  you can certainly tell that he doesn t know how to drive a car especially through the wider corners and even by the way he grips the wheel and places his seating position  you can also tell that he doesn t know how to describe the characteristics of the way a car handles beyond just being planted and low  so yes  most of the time i wouldn t expect a tech guy to be able to throw around a car  the verge also has some pretty dreadful car reviews as well ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12074,i have said it on other videos  but the value in the new nsx will  or will not  be borne out by it is reliability   the first nsx did not blow it is contemporaries with performance  it blew them away by being as quick but also very usable and very reliable   i have 268 000 miles on my  92  vintage  nsx  i track it regularly and it is still pretty solid  even having been pretty neglected prior to my ownership   if the new car is half as trouble free and easy to daily drive as the original it will be looked at very kindly down the road    also    careful on those race tracks you might end up addicted  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12139,i know what you mean bro  but even as someone who loves hondas i would not play 189k for a honda acura  same thing ya know  the whole point of a japanese sports car is to be cheap and still destroy the competition  at least that is how i see it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12142,vtec kickedin   i am a honda fanboy too but i think you have the wrong mentality about it   the original nsx was designed to compete with italian exotics at about a 75  of the cost   keywords  compete with  not destroy   this car starts at 150k which is nothing these days for a super car   have you seen how expensive a hurracan is or a new mclaren   this car is a bargain bro and can hang with them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12154,the price is still too high for a honda  the brand is not strong enough for that price even if it is a supercar  you are looking max 70k price tag and that is pushing  unfortunately times have moved on and nsx as a brand is far behind everyone else  they need to position themselves as the first supercar for the aspiring supercar fan or middle class person and a reasonable price tag  trust me they would sell cars in volume and gain consumer trust again in no time  unfortunately being or looking expensive does not attract sales or new wealthy fans   a bit of advice there ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12165,i wouldn t call the nsx a super car  more of a high end sports car   super cars that this review would be different in    mclaren 650s    lamborghini hurucan   porsche 911 turbo gt3   ferrari 488 gtb or 458  maybe a better review would ve been in a hyper car   lamborghini aventador    mclaren p1    ferrari laferrari    porsche 918    bugatti chiron,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12188,please  you are wonderful at reviewing tech leave the cars alone,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12189,the best thing about having your own channel is doing what you want  i am pretty sure some random guy will not change that  if you think people are watching marques review cars because he is a car expert  i think you are not understanding what entertains the more than half a million people that watched this in less than a day ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12190,your life is so awesome  car companies just giving you a car like this baby for an entire week ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12191,yeah  is not it  i had always wanted the original nsx since before he was probably born and he gets to drive the new one for a week   and other supercars too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12192,it is not all fun and games  he works very hard to earn that opportunity  and he had to work hard to review it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12193,you do know he has to shoot and edit fuck load of footage  right  also write script  narrate whole thing ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
12194,you are one of many that do not seem to understand the effort it takes  after receiving the car  he cannot just park it in front of his house and look at it for a week  he needs to deliver  acura wants him to show certain parts of the car   mention some of its features and they may have even rented the track for him  he is expected to return it in pristine condition so there is the extra pressure of driving a supercar on a track you have never been to  without track experience  and having to perform at least decently  there is hours upon hours of footage to select  cut  edit  put together  render  send to acura for approval  make changes  it is not all fun and chill ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12195,paul g  sorry about the wall of text i m about to drop on you  but i like sharing my experience with anyone  you don t have to read it if you don t want too  i don t mind  anyway  i stopped uploading videos on my channel for several months now i think  and after a few short years of being a youtuber  i learned first hand experienced how time consuming and demanding it is to just upload one video a day  people who ve never done this before thinks youtuber has it easy and think it s mostly just playing games and screaming into the mics and making easy cash from it  but honestly it could be just as tought as a regular full time job if not more  so again hour wise it s like a full time job  maybe more  it took my friends  who are also relatively new to doing youtube  anywhere from 2 to 3 hours recording session a day  then it can take anywhere from 5 to 6 hours to fully edited it down to an 8 to 14 minutes video  and depending on your computer spec it could take you another 30 minutes or hours more just to convert it to files for uploading  and if you also create your own thumbnail it could take another 30 minutes to an hour worth of your time  and depending on your internet speed it could take you all the way up to hours to completely upload your video to youtube  and if you could be looking to do that all over again tomorrow  so you could potentially looking at at least 40 hours work week like a regular full time job  8 hours a day 5 days a week  or even more  unlike a regular job you don t benefits like 401k or health and dental  also you don t get weekends or nor holidays off if you build a large fanbase and they demand you upload at least once a day every  otherwise they get mad and might even drop their subscriptions from your channel  so yes  youtube can be extremely demanding on the body and mind if you don t have the passion or have what it takes to make a successful living of from it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12212,techvarium these will never be  50k  they may possibly bottom around  75k however ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12213,james brown right now you can get a new nsx at around  150k  tell me  if they are overpriced  what other supercar goes for  150k that is better than the nsx  it is not a corvette  it is much better than one  it is also not a gt r  an r8 which is slower than the nsx  will run you about the same or more depending on the options and plus version   when people say the nsx is overpriced  they are repeating the same ignorant comments a lot of people are saying  just because a lot of people all say the same thing  does not make it true  the nsx is a far less expensive porsche 918  the thing to keep in mind here is that this is a hybrid for performance  just like the almost  1 million 918  the nsx has turbos but zero turbo lag due to the electric motor attached to the engine  the front electric motors do what is known as real torque vectoring  what that means is that the cpu constantly adjusts the the output of the electric motors up front so as you take fast hard turns  the car rides as if on rails  allowing you to corner much better than you can in many other sports cars performance cars  there is nothing like the nsx costing less than it or even a little more than it  the future is all electric but long before we get to that future  supercars will all become hybrids just like the nsx and porsche 918  ferrari is rumored to already be working on their next supercar which is said to be a nsx like hybrid ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12348,i really like watching marques videos on tech  but to be honest cars videos is not his thing  for people who do not know about cars i am sure they may feel like they learned something  this video is absolutely boring  and it would of been better if he knew about cars to actually make a car video but that is not the case  and on top of that he is not really a real track driver or so he cannot really give us good feed back on the car when it comes to the track  i hope he only sticks to the tech plz,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12357,hi marques  nice video  i realy like the format  so i got two question  how is your highed  i am 6 5 or 1 96m and i can not sit comftable in the most cars that are sporty  so it would be interessting how much space is betwen your head and the roof  2  do you buy the tesla roadstar  i can t believe it  does this thing cost two million dollar  how get you so much money  anyway  thanks for your great films and sorry for all the mistakes in this comment  i am german and not use to write in english ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12360,mkbhd  my black doug demuro  but eeeeeeeven better  by the way the old nsx was by far my fav car when i was a child  and as i had the chance to sit in and drive the new nsx  i have to say  it is a very cool car  but to be honest  i would not pay that much for a  honda  even with all the quirks  features  gimmicks  hybrid stuff etc  a nice porsche provides more value  a fully equipped lambo has a higher  wow  factor  and if you are eager to pay 200k for a supercar  maybe have a look at the new tesla roadster  same cool futuristic modern design  but every time you put the pedal to the medal  you appreciate the extra bucks you spent on that tesla  just my opinion though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12403,overpriced   nissan skyline is way cheaper and easier to tune   the nsx price will easily reach well over 230 000 dollars just by changing the rims and adding carbon fiber little wing   not to mention its the only acura in it entire lineup that has an ugly key hole in the door   they should have just did a 3 5  litter v6 turbo vtec and call it a day instead of making a super complicated engine car smh smh ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12624,i am an environmentalist too  but do not be so narrow minded in thinking all  hybrid  tech is solely developed for tree hugging  developing new tech for a few luxury or hyper performance cars eventually trickles down to affordable efficiency gains in normal mass produced cars that will make a difference to our atmosphere  personally  i think it is too late  we are already in a runnaway climate change scenario ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12697,again  not the point  he covers what it is like to live with a supercar  it is not a review  he is a tech guy who happens to like cars casually  if you want to see a proper review  there are proper channels for those kinds of videos by people like chris harris and such ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12733,watch some vehicle virgins for real daily driving supercars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12734,when you make a car video  make a car video  not your average joe riding around in an acura nsx  make it real  jump into the game  talk about the things that really matter  nobody fucking cares about how many cupholders it has  even if it is a  living with a supercar  video   i want to see the back sliding around and the tyres screeching you to stop  do that and the car game will have some competition otherwise it is just a nerd in a supercar   look man  i do not mean no offense  i want to see you grow  but you have to talk about the things that matter  there is a whole community you can tap into if you just talk about the right things  and by right things  i do not mean that you follow and copy others  but if you are talking about a supercar and not even telling the engine configuration then what is the point  you said six cylinder twin turbo engine supported by 3 electric motors  now what is the displacement  what type of engine is it  is it an inline six or a v6  what is the size of motor  how much total horsepower it makes  torque figure  you said none of this shit man    i love your videos man  you have an audience  you know the craft  just do not make this kind of mistake  love your stuff  just do a better job next time  peace ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12742,the price on them has dropped huge amount because no one wants them  you can pick one up for 130k,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12743,i would estimate the 991 2 3rs would have at least a 150k market adjustment right now  so i do not think you have got any chance at getting one for 200k,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12744,amen,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12745,looks more like a sporty honda civic to be honest  if your going to pay that much for a car looks and functionality should be top notch ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12746,made8202010 its looks and functions are top notch though,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12748,was just thinking that lol i will take a dodge challenger demon for less then 100k pricing on them is always moving around though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12749, fakename287 just my opinion i do not find it that great looking especially for  189k  maybe because i do not particularly find acura s designs attractive  the body tries to copy like the lambo type body and the back and front looks straight pruis civic lambo want to be hybrid  seems very functional as a sports car only but for that price  i feel like you can do better especially with the shitty back up camera etc  its only built for a track and that is basically it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12750,ragnarok it s still an over price piece for shit  you get can get a mclaren 570s for about the same price or even a corvette zr1 for half the price and it performs way better  the nsx was definitely a let down,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12751,if you knew anything about cars  you would know that porsches are actually pretty damn reliable  especially for sportscars   supercars  probably more reliable in the long run than this acura with all its tech  not to speak of the fact that a gt3 is simply the better car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12903,much worse  p1 is a masterpiece compared to this,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12904,yes  good video though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12905,i think it translates the million dollar appeal of the p1 quite well into the 200k bracket  still a ton of money  but not really comparable for that alone   of course it does not come too close  note that there are currently no comparable sport hybrid offerings  although i have heard the new 911s will all get some kind of electrical assistance   the stats on the nsx are still stellar  2 9  let alone that it all functions on the road  and the feeling of sporty hybrids  the snappiness  is not even fully reflected in the stats  i would also get many cars over it  an r8 for one  but i feel like people discredit the nsx too easily  also  looking back 20  years the actually interesting cars are the ones of which when new people said they were not for everyone  i feel ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12906,how much is the p1 again ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12907, starblockss alot,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12908,1150k dollars when new  currently going for 1 3 2 5m  and the gtr version was 3 5m when new  probably 5  now if you are even allowed to resell them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12909,you cannot buy this car  dumbass,[1 0 1 0 1 0]
12910,javen t but the p1 was already in a different league compared to this  still  does not mean it is bad  and racing versions of it  e g  the gt500 or gt3 versions look just as beautiful ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12911,for the usa it is rebranded to acura i guess to make it sound more premium then it is  here in europe it is know as it is original which is honda nsx so that might make you think more about the lower level of this car  specially if you compare it to a true premium like mclaren,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12912,calling any car a crap p1 is a compliment,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12913,more of a cut price porsche 918  and the nsx has front axle torque vectoring  which the 918  and the p1 for that matter  did not have,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12914,it is also a fraction of the price of a mclaren p1  which cost  1 35 million when new ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12948,hey you should cover the lexus lc500 too  since it is a 2 2 like the roadster and it is a hybrid by the way  turn on the interior lights next time so you do not look so dark in there  and you did not talk about things like torque vectoring so maybe get a car guy to help you with all the details about the car  and a drone to shoot some footage on track ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12987,pretty cool looking car  but for that price there is better cars out there  the nsx is just a fraction of the amazing ness that it was when it first launched ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12988,although the honda nsx mk2 is an amazing car  you have to admit that it s a failure because of his  190 000 asking price  for less than that you can get a lamborghini huracan  ferrari 488  mclaren 650s or porsche 911 turbo and although they might not be as technologically advanced as the honda  the vast majority of people buying a super car do not have a track and are buying for the badge  looks  sound  statement or to represent a milestone that they achieved ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

12996,japanese cars are so boring  universally  this is a bit less boring   the front still looks like some lame family car though  if you drive a japanese car you are boring as f  like the cars  supercar  superdull  sure  for this moeny you could get so many good exciting cars   why go japanese  makes no sense ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12997,acura nsx has always been the go to practical super car  i know a lot of people have this mind block that a super car must come from one of  the eu manufacturers ala ferrari  lamborghini  pagani etc   but no  both the nsx and the lfa are extremely good cars with a lot of performance built in  do not know how a lfa would hold in terms of value but the nsx has more than tripled in terms of its resale price over its original price of   50k   nice video  would love to see a quick comparison between the toyota lfa and the acura nsx from you marcus  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12998,tf you talking about  i see you do not know anything about the subject at all  this car has never been 50k  this  successor  of the og nsx is not selling at all and it is price is going down,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
12999, bozhidardimitrov3573 what was the price of the of a new nsx 1991  it started from 60k  and what is a good 1991 nsx available for these days  some where in the vicinity of 135 k to a 155 k ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13000, cj3b1 i see you are talking about the og nsx as i initially thought but then deleted this part of my comment  i understood you meant the new nsx as the video is about it and you also compared it to the lexus lfa which is a relatively new car so i think the comparison is senseless  in such case i agree with your point but it just does not seem clear you talk about the old car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13001, bozhidardimitrov3573 no problem  i have asked for the comparison between the two as they are both from japanese manufacturers  i well know how the lfa differs from the nsx both in terms of price and performance   my reason to ask is a simple one  both are touted to be  that super car  one could use on a daily basis ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13002,i was thinking that you have rimac c2  d,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13003,the honda nsx would be the perfect supercar for me  i know it does not look like it is legendary predecessor but i love the new age design  sure it might not be as timeless as the previous gen nsx but it has the potential to look classier and exotic  the thing that is stopping it is the honda acura badge  but i genuinely think this is an underrated and an overhated car  on a side note i love the autofocus series  these videos are one of the best shot ones in the business and i think car reviewers should learn a thing or two from mkbhd ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13004,i beg to differ  the current gen  as well as previous gen  nsx is a timeless design ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13005,only speaking for myself  but badge makes no difference to me  my daily is an audi s5 and i would still buy it if it had a volkswagen badge  i would actually prefer it have a vw badge  anyway  i like the new nsx  the original is a bucket list car for sure ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13006,yeah and that is why i actually think it is just like a nsx  the orginial nsx got all its hype later  people hated on the orginial nsx to  saying its not a real super car etc,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13007,it is 189 000 for a motherfucking v6  boi you need the getting you are ass in a tesla roadster  audi r8  or amg gtr ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
13008,i like the acura logo better,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13009, ahangoel 1  the roadster will not be coming for another two years   everything else stands so it is ok   2  it will likely follow the typical tesla tradition of untouchable straight line acceleration  3   at the expense of battery health   4  and then you take it somewhere like laguna seca or willow springs  again  battery health  as well as motor  inverter and battery temperatures  right now  the last word in terms of high performance electric cars that will not balk at the mere suggestion of track work is the nio ep9,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13010,the nsx and supra were perfectly designed cars  they could very well upgrade the electronics  some composite and leave the old style and interior as it was  i  think  toyota may be going that supra mk4 look ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13011,i like this web serious ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13013, ahangoel i have a soft spot for the amg gt r,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13014,it is a good car but not even close to being worth the prize tag  the easiest assessment of all time  when it came out  it was barely better than a  minimally upgraded in almost 10 years  nissan gtr in performance and usability   comfort  and cars are getting so much more amazing at every price point in the last few years  that a nissan gtr is not even a great value anymore today  and you get this  i honestly do not know the logic behind buying this except as a 3rd or 4th toy car for collection   uniqueness  the only thing is that it is a hybrid super car  which you do not have an easy alternative outside the million dollar trio  p1  la ferrari  918  which cannot be obtained easily even with the money  but nsx does not hang with them in any form to begin with  on the track a porsche gt3 rs will kill this both in performance and in fun   driver connection  amg gt r is also underappreciated   i think people have weird assessments when it comes to expensive cars as if suddenly price tag and value do not matter  i make good money and do not own a super car yet as i stick around the 100k mark and value is everything when making a purchase decision  i also know people who drive 100 200k cars during tracks or daily life  and everyone compare cars in a value sense of whether the fun  the experience  and the package is worth the price or not  not everyone who owns a 200k car thinks they are the best  i have heard plenty complaints and regrets in very different ways  in that manner porsche will always be among the top  you do not get to ignore a 10k difference in price tag until you are well into the 300k  i admit i have not driven an nsx in person so i may be missing some crucial stuffs  but in my mind there is no way it can justify the price tag  i have driven every other car mentioned in my post  if only for a test ride with friend s car or the sorts  maybe there is a reason i do not know anyone who owns this irl  oh right i have also driven an audi r8 v10  on track before  probably a better choice as well  nothing quite compares to the gt3 rs on track  however ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13036,your animations are sick,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
13037,i have some constructive criticism  i think that this was not a good review   because you did not mention these important things about the car     it is easy and comfortable to drive  yet has amazing precise handling     it is very powerful with amazing gas mileage for a sportscar     it is expensive  for that price you have a lot of options     it has no cool safety features      when you went to the racetrack you should have started that scene with some fast quick engine roaring shots  the drone shots made it feel slow and tame    less you inside talking  more shots from the outside  your tech reviews are amazing  but you have to approach things differently maybe when it comes to cars  it is a different crowd ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13038,the red light at 1 02 what is this  it looks like there is just a cheap lightbulb behind a cheap red plastic  and theses plastic looking grills  ugh,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13039,the nsx looks great and has great performance  i just hate the automatic transmission  which is also my complaint with most supercars  and i know people thinking being  05 seconds faster is better  but me  i want to shift my own gears  and it should be an option on every car  you want your automatic  cool  but i want a manual transmission  that is my problem with automakers these days is lack of options ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13098,you could daily this car  but even hardcore car guys probably would not  you cannot drive your expensive car everyday without losing money  losing money means  lesser chance of a next  better car   that is why no one dailys there supercars  you drive them sporadically  sell them after a year maybe two  and then buy another ne  that way it will keep some of it value and keep the cost of ownership down   the 2020 roadster on the otherhand is maybe a bit different  you better get the most out of it because in 20 years the batteries will not hold charge and you might not be able to unleash the beast  so i think you could daily the roadster  a bit crazy but a hell of lot of fun ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13099,this is not a supercar and also it is not that expensive to be considered an investment by rich people  it is not a limited edition  nor it is powerful enough to be considered special  its problem is that noone is buying it at all because there are better alternatives,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13132,no,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13133,the thing is that this is mainly a tech channel  not a car channel  if you want more the grand tour style stuff  check out gears and gasoline  they just did a road trip from florida to alaska in 4k ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13159,this was a great video  light years better than your lambo video  but you know  i still think this idea of  performance   means going really fast is strange  when i think of the performance of a car i think of how safe it is to drive and how easy it is to handle  all super cars seem to brush that aside for speed that can really only be used on the track  which just tells me they are awful cars for the real function of cars  if it was a  track  only purchase than that would all make sense  you wouldn t need to care if other drivers can see you or not  you wouldn t need to care about every bump in the road because there aren t any bumps  driveways don t exist on a track  race cars are made for the track  putting those kinds of cars on the road where other people who aren t thinking about going really fast and who want a safe road is incredibly unsafe  these cars sounds like great sport gear but awful all around cars for the sake of other people on the road  with that being said  driving one of these on the road is less  making trade offs  and more being inconsiderate of other people and safety for all on the road ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13267,lamboplays then he has to experience a gt2rs but that s probably not going to happen,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13268,marc degasperi gt2rs does not have the fun factor of the gt3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13269,toaster and noise has a lot to do with fun factor  porsches flat 6 is one of the best sounding engines currently on the market i am going to next to a ferrari v12  another thing is the fact that it revs to 9000rpm and does not drive as fast which make for a more fun car in my opinion,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13270,kind of depends on what aspect is fun  i would personally say the gt2rs as being more fun than the gt3 on the sole basis that to get maximum fun out of both the cars you need to be on a track  then the gt2 really gets to stretch its legs  though as a very good counterpoint a gt3 is much easier to extract more fun when on the street ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13662, toasty6776 spot on  marques called nsx a  race car that happens to have a license plate on  but i do not really agree with that  nsx  r8  huracan  488  720s   those are all supercars  but they can be tame and relatively comfortable with correct settings so they can be daily driven  if you can live with next to no storage space  gt2 rs  amg gt r  mclaren senna  etc  on the other hand are different beasts  those actually are race cars that are  barely  street legal and are definitely more raw and probably far less pleasant to drive every day ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13761,yeah i totally agree  although modern  electric  cars are becoming more like the tech products they are used to reviewing  i take these reviews with a grain of salt compared to the reviews done by actual car reviewers    the tech reviewers just do not have the knowledge and comparisons to review cars properly,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13762, i cannot tell if i am a good driver or not   just that quote is enough for me not to trust anything he has to say about the performance  handling  of the car but i did enjoy seeing his reactions about everyday driving  he will have to go to a racing school  learn how to drive on track  understand the engineering  only then do i think he will be a good reviewer  as for other tech tubers  they will have to go through the same process ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13812,yeah  and you can tell he is not really a car guy  and he is just jumping right into the craziest cars  i know that having crazy flashy cars like this and the lambo is more interesting to a non car enthusiast audience  but i would love to seem him drive some much more barebones cars  master the basics of car control  and then drive some super advanced cars  then he would have a frame of reference to compare to  if he went to just a few hpde days and learned how to drive at the limit  maybe track a manual miata or something where you can fully exploit the performance of the car  understand weight transfer  understeer oversteer  rev matching heel toeing etc  then a supercar review would be much more interesting because he would  a  be able to at least drive the car aggressively and see what it is made of  and b  talk about the improvements with all the power tech  if he got used to driving a stickshift car and then jumped into a dual clutch with shifts in the milliseconds  and electric motors filling those gaps with torque  i am sure he would have a lot more to say about those systems as he would see the improvement they bring not just have that improvement as his baseline  i understand not doing it though because most of the audience will not be that into just seeing him learn car control in a 150hp roadster  but i would  maybe on a second bonus channel or something  also he is obviously a super busy guy who maybe cannot commit that much time to fucking around on a skidpad at a driving school ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13843, nudl3zz i believe it is acura nsx only in the us and honda nsx elsewhere i could be wrong though,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13844, hectoure  you are right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13845,but they do have honda in the us  right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13846, nudl3zz i do not think so if you were to purchase one in the united states it would be an acura but they are essentially the same car with a different badge on the hood,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13847, nudl3zz yes but acura is a separate division for premium or sport cars  specifically made in and for us  but yes  there are also  normal  hondas in the us,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13848,because the original japanese version is honda when it was brought overs sees it was given the acura monicker just like how lexus is an expensive toyota and infinite is the luxury version of nissan,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13849, costel coaie infinity ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13850,japanese honda s  the honda that most of the world buy are called acura in north america as honda have an american made selection of cars that they badge honda in the us  acura are perceived to be the premium brand  think toyota lexus  but in reality the difference is us japan,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13851,because the usa is a culture of labels and brands,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13852, nudl3zz yes  but the original nsx in the 90 s was also branded acura in the us,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13853,positive investing the most important thing on a supercar is the engine  calling acura a honda is not as degrading when you know honda s history of having dominated indy car racing for from the 70s to the 90s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13870,it is badged as an acura in part for import reasons or at least that used to be a big reason for the separate branding   the nsx is actually made close to where i live in central ohio ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13872,roland koller because in other countries honda isn t a cheap brand like it is in the us  nowhere else in the world would anyone say to another  lol you drive a honda  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
13873,nudl3zz toyota with lexus  nissan with infiniti  and honda with acura  all created their you s  market luxury sub brands  why  because america is one of the largest new car markets in the world and they understand that americans  more so than people in any other country  assign a lot of importance to brands  to names  when it comes to spending money  the japanese brands wanted to sell higher end cars but their research showed them that americans would not be willing to pay tens of thousands more for the same brands that they were used to paying far less for  they all had the exact same business plan but unfortunately for honda  acura never grew to be the luxury brand that lexus is and infiniti also failed to do as well as lexus in terms of american perception of the brand but infiniti did come in 2nd place ahead of acura   all of the sub brand cars can be found in japan and around the world  without the sub brand badges because again  those luxury brands were designed only to cater to the american mind frame  so in other words  we americans are some stuck up human beings  hahaha  we pay a lot of money for something and we want the world to know it  in some countries  people with money actually try to do the opposite by not showing it because it is looked upon as something to be shameful ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

13877, nudl3zz they have honda in the us  and they also have acura  they call it an acura here because acura is honda s luxury and performance brand  they have to make it an acura here to show that it is a premium car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14060,the reason why acura is reaching out to mkbhd because the nsx is not sell well  they need all the publicity they can get because no 1 is buying them haha,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14061,exactly  not surprised though with a price to feel to look to performance like that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14062,yes because no one fucking asked for a car like this  we wanted something more practical like the original ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
14063,it is even worse that it is biased because of the sponsor,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14064, koltony the nsx outperforms the r8 and a base 911  of course it would cost more  a gtr nismo has similar performance and costs around the same as the nsx,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14065,shadow 144   because god forbid acura and their honda overlords actually make this car without all the electric motors for less money like we want   i also love that you have your option of a cupholder or a passenger     everything this car should be is the mclaren 570s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14066, skye higa the thing is  numbers are not everything  cars are more than just lap times  i would take an audi r8 any day instead of this because it is just better in every other way  except for performance  by a small margin  what i am saying is  other cars at this price range from audi and porsche do much more in other areas  making them more of an all rounder  which is what you want from a car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14135,do you classify the corvette as a supercar,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14136,the corvette z06 is a specialty sports car  but chevy is trying to push it now as a super car  the term super car has been watered down so much even this silly nsx is being called super ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14137, phodacbitch the zr1 is definitely a super car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14143,try the new a class next  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14144,the nsx is the most depriciated car the best spec  you can get is much less than msrp  as the car is not much sold and company has ton of cars seating and dealers want to sell the car any how if they get a loss than also,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14145,let us be real here for a second  if you can afford a super car like that  you can afford a secondary utility vehicle aka actual day to day vehicle while the super car is for super fun driving  love that blue on the nsx by the way,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14146,with a 3 1 0 60 i would hardly call that a supercar  oh and it is an acura lol what is ironic is marques  daily driver is faster than this shit lmao,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
14147,lulzroyce stupid ass  0 60 is 2 9 second  a lamborghini huracan does it also in 2 9 seconds  and tesla s are fucking slow past 80 100 mph  if you re going to talk shit at least know what you re talking about ,[1 0 1 0 1 0]
14148,and secondly you re making it sound like 3 1 seconds is slow    there are many super cars that do 0 60 in 3 3 3 9 seconds  get a life,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14154,what do you thing of the polestar 1  it that also a good car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14155,read the follow up comments for a complete view of my opinion i am sorry but the new nsx is not a supercar  it is only a super sports car  it has a v6 hybrid that produces little hp compared to supercar levels  it cannot actually even do 0 60 in 2 9 seconds  i do not know where you got that  it does it in 3 flat or slower  it is also very  very tame with modest styling nowadays  it is just boring and the comparison to a race car made me cringe  it fails to uphold the nsx name of the prior 2 generations and should be a completely different model  it is not like the market disagrees with me because you can pick brand new ones for  50 000 off sticker  i do not completely disagree with you  i mean if a auto manufacter gave me a crappy  supercar  for a week i would not completely berate it for being an awful product  in fact i would not say anything other than numbers and known facts so i would not hurt their feelings  exactly what you did ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14156,the ferrari 488 has a 0 60 time of 2 9 seconds  the porsche 911 gt3 rs also has a 0 60 time of 2 9 seconds  having the nsx s 0 60 time of 3 seconds compared to these supercars makes it a supercar as well  plus  a supercar does not necessarily need to be solely dependent on speed  a supercar is also judged by it is handling  how well it takes corners  and the nsx in my opinion  would be considered a supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14157,damn  my 97 wrangler gets the same mpg i should just trade it for an  nsx ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14158,not a super car  even the gtr beats it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14527,no offense  but the typical marques shots  do not really translate well to cars  for some constructive criticism  if this is a car  review  it would be great to get some more b roll of the details of the car  things that are interesting  not to copy doug demuro  i know the topic of this video is about living with a super car  then maybe it would have made more sense to just straight up talk about that instead  rather than having to explain all the drive modes  just say which one you would probably stick with for daily ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14576,but what s the doug score ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14577,the new nsx was a terrible venture  they took a classic japanese masterpiece and turned it into an american piece of  meh  not worth it  dealerships had to mark these cars below msrp to get them to sell well after the initial hype upon release  do not believe me  search autotrader for dealer only 2018 models and you will find them marked down into the  160 000s  it is not a bad car  but it is not lfa status and nobody wants a  190 000  honda when that will also put you in a top of the line mercedes  a v12 aston martin  or a v10 lamborghini  it is not even that great of a collector s car so it is not good from an investment standpoint either  this vehicle is generally regarded as a flop ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14584,there are people out in the world starving but people are buying super cars and mansions       only a hand full of good hearted  rich  people care for the poor  hell  i don t need things like this because i know when i die i can t bring it with me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14693,the groovy guitar dude hell  it s not even supercar fast  maybe a sports car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14694,you all both crazy if you think this car are not fast  what  sports  car does 0 60 in 3 seconds flat  aaalso 191 mph is wicked fast,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14695,tesla is just fast for some seconds then it s over,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14702,if you have ever tracked a car  the tesla is only fast on a straight line for 1 8 mile drag racing  that is about it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14703,its faster than a tesla  the tesla has difficulty reaching 150 mph  which this acura can do with relative ease ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14707,this car  or at least the concept of it  is better than a tesla  it s got the best of both worlds  the immediate acceleration of the electric motors  and the higher consistent top speed of the combustion engine ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14708,epitome soul kayanzeblanda yeah but would you want to go 150mph is not 70 80 the speed limit in highways  so being fast on straight lines from 0 60 is really what anyone driving should want,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14709,ry indeed  not many people get that  it is a nice daily driver  once of the few supercars you can dd  and i can turn it to electric mode when i get in the garage to not piss off everyone   i tracked it let me tell ya that car they nailed the practicality and civilized but the thing can go wild  i do not know  pulling at a gas station to fill the tank while sipping a coffee and just getting a couple of thumbs up feels better than people losing their freaking mind because you are driving a 15 years old ferrari or lambo   it is called class  this acura nsx has class  kind of like porsche ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14710,you have not tracked the model 3 performance with track mode ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14713,tesla s are not fast  they are quick  there is a difference,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14714,tesla is faster in a quarter mile i think but definetly not faster in the long run  the difference between a quick car and a fast car  i am a tesla fan but the model s has its limits  now the brand new roadster is a totally different story ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14728, foxdie1001 if it did not have the electric motors  and was not so modernly styled  it would tarket japanese car enthusiasts  sadly  they are usually not the ones with fuck off money  hence the og nsx also died ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14729,i am not here to argue  but the ford gt has a twin turbo v6 and that thing is like 500 grand ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14730, foxdie1001 the problem with the nsx is that honda kept talking about how they were going to make another one for so long  it built up this expectation that the car could never achieve because of what they did  in the case of it is appeal  it is not the v6 that deters people from buying it  several supercars have 6 cylinders  turbocharged engines are more economical than their na counterparts  less so in the case of supercars  but  economical  buyers are not buying  190 000 supercars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14941,personally i am not a fan of the car since this car was a major flop and it was a disappointing car to many car enthusiasts  when it comes to supercars i feel like the honda nsx may be close to a  supercar  to the feel and look of it but in reality it is not a supercar more like a hybrid sports car in my opinion  if you would want a supercar feel and experience i would preferably go for brands like ferrari  mclaren  lamborghini  and so on  i feel like this car failed to live up to the supercar name because of the underpowered engine and a hybrid system no one asked for in an nsx  overall i cannot really agree saying this is a  supercar  but that is just my opinion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14942,loved the video but you called the spoiler a diffuser,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
14943,will be interesting how alot of these things compare to the 2020 roadster  for example  it probably sits higher because of the battery  has more storage  not a lot more  because there is not an engine taking up half the size of the car  it also may have more dynamic suspension if they go with air suspension   hopefully less tradeoffs with the roadster than a typical super car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

14969,if i had the money i would buy a super car just to drive at the track during the weekend   but that is about it  i would never drive a car like this every day  to go to work or shopping etc  personally  i would prefer to get a nice mercedes or bmw or porsche if i wanted more power but also usability in most condition  winter shitty road etc     by the way i have a civic 2016 lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15128,its not s a super car  just a really expensive car unfortunately called the nsx  buy the real nsx or other real supercar  you did not even bring up the original nsx  the famous one that is worth more than the new one dumbass  pls actually do research before blindly reviewing this car  the 1990s nsx is a legend and that was a true supercar for practicality  there is a reason why its so beloved and the new one is not  if you had talked about this it would have been fine  pls just actually do you are job and know why this car is a failure and why its predecessor is a legend and icon ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15331,for all of you people using 0 to 60 times to justify it being a super car  it is you cannot categorize it the same as a fully gas car  it is using an electric motor to accelerates and it has linear acceleration as opposed to a engine that has to shift gears  yeah it might have some nice acceleration but i mean if you are looking at raw horsepower once it gets up to speed it is going to get smoked by any real supercar  it would not even be close,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15341, asv77 my point in saying that was that you were comparing the number of units produced to an f355 and all i was saying that because the f355 was not a flagship they produced more so you should compare it to something else  like another flagship car more along the lines of an nsx,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15417,this is the best series on the channel,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15418,i would not say an nsx would be a supercar  more of a high end sports car  like a gt r   by the way  love your channel ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15419,yeah i agree with you  a sports car that is not that widely popular  but still looks pretty cool got to admit,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15420,inaccurate  both the nsx and the gt r are super cars  they both have sub 3 second 0 60 and are nimble around the track ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15421,lol fine whatever ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15422,they both post supercar numbers  agreed  but the tesla model x s  is capable of sub 3s too  not considered a supercar  just numbers do not define a supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15423,the gtr is a supercar ya dipshit ,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
15424, cristianswift7166 super cars are not about performance  other wise a corvette with a turbo would be considered a super car  super car to most car people has to hit another point  rarity  nsx is not that uncommon  also some add in sound as a criteria  this 6cylinder nsx sound does not even match that of a v8 in a mustang which is a fraction of the price   non gt v8 option being as low as 35 40k ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15425,solely  about performance sorry,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15426,flyronflyk wtf are you talking about it of course its a super car  now   that does not mean it is a massive disappointment  compared to the og,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15427,just because its fast around a track does not make it one  an m4 is just as fast around a track  i would still consider it a high end sports car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15428,the gt r out performs the ferrari 458 and it weighs significantly more so therefore it is a supercar,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15429,flyronflyk well no shit the m4 is not limited production neither mid engine  ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
15430, leecason9468 super cars are purley about performance  if it had to do with rarity than a rolls royce phantom is a super car  but it is not ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15431,so does the dodge demon in a straight line  would you consider that a  supercar  supercars are not just defined by numbers ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15432, flyronflyk that is completely inaccurate  a nsx would most definitely beat a bmw m4  easily ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15433, cris james i was actually comparing the m4 to the gt r ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15434,flyronflyk a dodge demon is still considered a muscle car  different category to begin with ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15435, flyronflyk that is because a tesla model x is a utility vehicle that may have a fast 0 60 but would otherwise be destroyed around a track by supercars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15436, cristianswift7166 i never said that rarity was the only category  maybe you need to learn to read  and write  it is purely not purley   super car criteria no order 1  performance 2  price  sub 200k is iffy  3  design 4  sound  nsx loses out here with a bee hive sounding 6 cylinder  5  rarity  nsx is too common  most car guys agree on these   hyper car takes it to the next level and most agree the price has to be 1 million plus   if performance was the only criteria  tricked out supras should be considered super cars  there are supras that beat aventadors  does not mean it is a super car like the aventador ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15437,even the gtr you know it from playstation,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15438,ns x and the gt r are both super cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15439, pacman1789 muscle car is a very hard to define term as well  i hate to sound preachy  but american muscle has really changed a lot  mustangs and camaros used to be considered muscle cars  but a lot of car enthusiasts would argue that they are american sport  or even more popularly pony cars  dodge challenger and subsequently the demon may be more like a muscle car than the mustang and camaro  but it is not really so clear cut anymore ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15440,wow this comment got a lot more attn  than i was expecting lmao   just to re iterate my point  numbers alone do not define a supercar  there are numerous factors apart from numbers like  history  racing pedigree  exclusivity  etc  the nsx and gt r are no doubt incredibly fast but so is an m4  rs5  c63  vette  etc  etc  i would not consider any of these as a  supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15441, leecason9468 first of all the nsx wins in performance  the price part i also cannot agree with because a nissan gt r is considered a supercar and is in the sub 200k range  even the nsx has the design win  and the rarity  in fact i see lamborghinis a lot more than i see the new generation of the acura nsx  also the hypercar price criteria that you claim to be  1 000 000 plus  that is also inaccurate  the porsche 918 spyder starts at  845 000 and it is considered a hypercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15442,flyronflyk not even close to a gt r,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15443,gt r fans get outta here a bugatti could easily beat it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15444,lee cason a mustang is still considered a muscle car unlike the camaro that is more a sports car but still with muscle car characteristics  the challenger is still a muscle car through and through  the demon is not a new car  the original demon came out in 1971 as a high performance version of the original dodge dart ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15445, cristianswift7166 actually never here anyone call the spyder a hyper car  but i could be wrong  and what does the nsx win against  i never said it was not fast  like almost everyone in this conversation but you  i will reiterate  performance does not equal supercar  and no the gtr is not a supercar  the interior is garbage and most consider it a super sport or sport car  meaning between sport and supercar or just sport car  it does not check enough boxes to be a supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15446, leecason9468 the current z06 and zr1 are basically super cars now though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15447, pacman1789the mustangs today can corner a track like crazy especially the gt350d they are far from being a muscle car anymore ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15448,they are absolutely super cars people just care too much about badging ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15449, kpopnidontstop yes in performance  and for the last damn time  performance does not  equal sipercar  they are rather common  there is a reason almost every decently popular drag channel has at least two or three videos with both the z06 and zr1  and i love corvettes  they are my favorite american car  i have wanted a stingray for the last 4 years since i started getting into cars  but they are not super cars  the z06 is not much better than a c7 stingray  they share a chassis and the extra power is wasted  horsepower and superchargers are not everything ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15450, leecason9468 the porshe 918 spyder is definitely a hyper car in every way,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15451, cristianswift7166 do you need to write your whole sentence in all caps like a five year old  i said  i could be wrong  jesus christ ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15452, pacman1789 how is the mustang a muscle car still   genuine question  just like the camaro they were both american muscle back in the 60s  mustang  and 70s  camaro  but i would say they are both sports cars now  they are comfortable  more nimble on the track than muscle cars ever we are  and they do not really have a muscle car vibe  i would say the new gt is even more sports car than the camaro  i could be wrong though,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15453,kpopnidontstop muscle cars were very much like sports cars of their generation  they tracked muscle cars just like they track sports cars today ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15458,they are both super cars though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15459,lmao so many butthurt folks on hear voicing opinions  nsx is not a supercar  there are quite a few sportscars out there with supercar performance  that does not make it one   like the fifth time i have said it  an nsx in the category of sportscars makes it the best sportscar you can buy  putting it in the supercar category makes it the worst one you can buy   9 10 people would go for any other supercar than an nsx  lamborghini  mclaren  ferrari  aston martin  why would you spend close to  200k on an acura when you can get a mclaren  the higher the price tag the greater the desire for curb appeal  which the nsx fails to meet in the supercar category  supercars break necks not stats ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15507,they shouldn t have named it the nsx it isn t the same kind of car as the og nsx but it is still one of my favorite cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15508,shoulda named it the accord tt ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15509,yeah but is it a bad car in it if it s own right  no  it s fine  does it deserve the legendary name of the nsx  fuck no ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
15510,the orange president nsx   new sportscar experimental  if they remade the old car then it wouldn t be an nsx ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15511,snakerb then what does the rdx mean  it s an suv  and mass produced  so not experimental ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15512,snakerb my point is that it doesn t handle anything like the og definitely doesn t look like it or sound like it  it s also not a manual it s better on the track and is faster but it isn t as fun as the og,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15513,to me  that is more of a high end sportscar than a supercar,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15514,honestly,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15515,why though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15516,it is ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15517, cristianswift7166 the way i see it  that car may do 60 in 2 9sec and a top speed of 191mph but it would get smoked by a ferrari 488 or lambo huracan which are just normal supercars  to me  it rather competes with the corvettes and audi r8 which are fast sportcars  fast supercars include lambo aventador and ferrari f12 in my opinion ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15518,lol  as if sportscars do 0 60mph in less than 3secs ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15519, tinashetogara4710 it is a supercar  you just do not know shit about cars ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
15520, tinashetogara4710 the lamborghini huracan s  0 60 is 1 10 of a second faster ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15521, valentynesimbol9245 aight  if that is what you think,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15522,it is not what i think  it is a fact  you clearly do not know shit about cars other than ferrari and lambo probably from rap videos,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15523,nsx  0 60 in 2 9 sec  aventador svj  0 60 in 2 8 secs  812 superfast  0 60 in 2 9 sec  mclaren 720s  0 60 2 9 sec  yeah it is a supercar,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15524, tinashetogara4710 aslo the f12 is slower in the 0 60 than the nsx so what is your point  oh wait you do not have one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15525,it is funny how all of you are talking exclusively about acceleration time and not considering top speeds or potential lap times  both the ferrari 488 and lambo huracan are much faster than the nsx at nurburbring for example and their top speeds are quite abit higher  watch the grand tour and see that the nsx cannot even match a porsche 911 and is crushed by a mclaren 720s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15526,lol the r8 v10  is literally on the same chassis as the huracan  they drive very similarly,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15532,i know the demon  it is an insane american muscle car that is great at straights but far from the best at corners  it looks boring af ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15533,yeah you have no clue what you are talking about  the nsx is definitely a supercar  both in terms of acceleration and handling and looks and technology  your opinion of what you think it is does not matter  every automotive journalist and engineer and anyone who knows anything about cars will agree it is a true supercar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15534,it is a better supercar than anything else on the market ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15535,i always heard a car has to do 200mph to be a super car  i d rather have a zr1,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15543,well  if you say nsx you might get the opposite response you are thinking,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
15544, flashbash2 but a car like nsx was never intended to be used as a status symbol  it is for car enthusiast  but yeah unfortunately that is the world we live in where the brand is more important than the product  mercedes can put out a piece of shit and people will still break there necks to get one just so they can say they have a benz,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15551,it is actually underrated but for good reason  too pricy for what it can offer compared to the competition  i work in a semi rich plaza too and i have never seen a 2017 nsx on the streets nor on the parking lots  only lambos  ferraris  audi s  bmw s  lexus s and corvette s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

15709,for sports cars  you want rear wheel drive instead of all wheel drive  apart from more power loss from the drivetrain and the increase of weight  all wheel drive powertrain increases understeer and makes the steering feel more vague  for a drivers car  you don t want understeer but a little bit of oversteer and very sharp steering which a rear wheel drive car does best   all wheel drive   torque vectoring helps reduce understeer and make steering sharper while having superior traction to rear wheel drive  but torque vectoring is controlled by a computer so it can make the car feel unpredictable and feel like it s been controlled by a computer which in most cases has proven to make sports cars less fun to drive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

16071,3 points that make the mclaren 720s an amazing supercar  1 the steering wheel does not have any buttons which is great because it makes it look like a fantastic piece of carbon fiber art  and because mclaren s controllers you do not need any buttons on the steering wheel at all  and is super confortable to use  2  the infotainment system thankfully includes relevant information about your driving statistics and includes options such as reverse camera and voice commands for callingf and music i am looking at you ferrari  some of your cars are bloated of stuff  apart of the fact that the screen is facing the driver  which in this type of cars you usually have an infotainment in the center which can be awkward to use if it is on the center  3  that trunk is god tier in the supercar world  cars like the nsx have awkward trunks near the engine or no trunk at all such as the lamborghini huracan or the ford gt,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

16812,my favorite feature in marques    well  i got bored with all the reviewers unboxing  reviewing the 6t they all do differently but it is the same thing  and then marques comes into the show  he is always late but arrives in style he just mentioned the 6t to introduce something bigger and better  the beast mclaren itself the 720p that is what i like in marques the most always he has something different something exciting by the way i am a speed guy so mclaren makes me high    talk  write  to you guys in the next one  peace,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

16828,a lot of ice cars are going to have faster 60 100 times than electric cars  you are basically in the wheel house of the powertrain at those speeds so you are getting the full amount of torque the engine can offer  the charger hellcat had a faster 60 100 time than the p90d  couple that with the higher horsepower  and that explains why chargers are usually gaining on teslas  although they do not quite catch up  by the end of the quarter mile  and awd cars are good for torque  but they make the car unnecessarily heavy  which contributes to that 60 80 feeling  handling is more difficult  and most importantly   you cannot do burnouts in an awd car  and everybody loves burnouts ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

16944,mclaren has essentially replaced this car now  when they eventually bring out a spider version of a coupe the spider version always easily outsells the coupe  despite being over 30k more expensive  expect the same to happen this time  especially given there are fewer aerodynamic compromises with the spider version now  it opens closes at 30mpg  instead of 20mpg  and in a fraction of the time so much more practical  and like past spiders there is no compromises in handling  unlike a ferrari which turns to mush when you chop its roof off  feel sorry for other supercar manufacturers because they had not even caught up with the coupe and now the goalposts have been moved ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

17367,the only negative comment about the car was that  when the wing is up it reduces the visibility but it has a camera so that does not matter lol guys do not be fooled the 720s actually sounds like a vacuum cleaner and do you really think it can do 0 60 in 2 4 or 2 5 seconds that is nearly koenigsegg agera rs fastest car in the world  speeds  the 720s is overrated and hyped by owners because it will get them better chances of getting the next big mclaren that will not depreciate but will make them money  i would take a huracan performante or a 488 pista or an aventador svj over the 720s any day the 720 does not have any emotion it is just mechanical and boring it is like a tesla but with a combustion engine,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

17419,autofocus is improving dramatically but i still do not understand who his target audience is  he is too much of an amateur to appeal to automotive enthusiast  he does not really cover enough tech for it to appeal to tech geeks  he cannot drive erratically so it is not cool enough to appeal to children  all that is left is someone who knows nothing about cars but loves mkbhd  that is great but it is not going to bring in new subs and is not a long term solution  i would really like to see a proper review where he covers all of the things he already knows really well  tech  screen quality  parking sensor interaction  button feel  backup  360 or birdseye view camera quality  the market needs someone willing to point out how bad some of these things are  specifically backlight bleed from screens  just about every car on the market has an lcd panel in or around the dashboard and they all suck  quality i could care less about  poor refresh rate of the rpms or mph  does not matter much  when you are driving at night and that backlight is bleeding so intensely it really ruins your ability to relax,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

17586,ratmtbola well some of them are all renewable they are v green  they don t keep  on harming the environment every time you take it for a spin  on the contrary evs get greener and greener every minute you own it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17587, sinba4 that is true  but for most electric cars you have to drive them for hundreds of thousands of miles to break even with a conventional car in terms of total co2 emitted  plus the energy you use to charge the car is most likely not green either in many cases ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17588,i am sorry you are not up to date on ev front ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17589,do your research ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17590,most grids are a combination of some renewable sources  and they are becoming more renewable by day and thus the charging for ev is becoming greener every day  i hope you are not arguing on that and still leaning towards the ice car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17591, sinba4 i am up to date my friend  and i know that the production of batteries is extremely dirty and emits a ton of co2  and that is a fact  as for renewable sources  yes  they are getting more and more  but as of today  only about 17  of the energy in the us is renewable  which means for a large part  the energy you are using to charge your car is still dirty ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17592,ratmtbola so what s better buying evs which is getting greener by day or the ice which will be harming the more you drive    i rest my case,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17593, sinba4 as of today  i would still buy an ice car  simply because the production of the batteries is so troublesome and dirty  the best and greendest thing to do would be to just keep on driving the car you already have  because that is already been produced  every new car emits a ton of co2 when being built  but many people like you do not see that  they only see the small picture and the local emissions ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17594,ratmtbola well believe me  every ice head will have to face the hard truth eventually  the fact remains i am not sure my nation will survive to see that the ice and big oil go down but i am hoping you don t educate your youth with that attitude  i am not saying everyone has to throw their ice cars today but at least their new purchase has to be an ev or public transport for the sake of human race survival  ps i am living in maldives     the lowest point on planet earth ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17595, sinba4 of course  eventually we will all have to say goodbye to ice cars  no question about that  but i still think that it will take about 5 10 years until ev s will be ready to take over ice cars completely   greetings to the maldives  you are living in paradise man haha,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

17640,he has access to a gimbal  yet those shots were a lot shakier than expected  something tells me the shaky cam was intended  and a good choice too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17641,definitely on purpose,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17642,a stabilized video of a moving car looks boring if you are trying to get that intensity feel i am going to,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17643,what about the shaky shots of still objects  i think his b roll team slacks ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17644, drew311drew  he is not shooting an action film  this is intended to show off the car not create drama in the plot  also even if he was going for a certain feel for the video  why the inconsistency between smooth and shaky shots  at 6 00 vs 6 05 and 2 59 vs 2 43,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17645,you can clearly see the software image stabilization on 6 00  also  premiere s warp stabilizer is terrible ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17646,i guess there were some serious potholes that cannot be stabilized ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17647,sheldon roth actually like the shaky shots in the context of the car  helps convey speed  not everything has to be butter smooth  also you can stabilise shots in final cut pro x   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17648,erik vabrit jesus  let s call stop over analysing and just enjoy the show  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17649, erikvabrit7701  at 6 00 he defined the car as a head turner therefore he chose a stabilized shot to emphasize the beauty of the car while driving at 6 05 i think it is the point where the  intensity  of the car running on a highway   him saying that it is loud and it has unusual designs makes it more intense  but his monotonic speaking makes it less intense  at 2 43 he mentioned that the car is  fast  and thus if you put a shaky video there  it would really give more intensity than a stabilized one  mind again his monotone voice making it less intense  2 59 is the part where he is transitioning to specs so he puts some stabilized shot to make a sexy appealing look to it  i would rather put a slow mo shot of the engine at this part ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17650,you can tell he is not a car guy  like half the features that he describes are there in all the mclaren since the mp4 12c from 2012,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

17829,meh  such ostentatious cars do not appeal to me  give me an austin martin or a tesla over this any day of the week  in my opinion the mclarens  the ferraris and the lamborghini of the world  they just lack an elegance   they all be like  look at me  i am fast  i much prefer something that shows style and confidence over bravado  with that being said  to each their own  and at the end of the day i still appreciate their power and performance ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
17830,thanks for the car tech video nice to see some crossover and this one way to do it  keep up the good work  would been interesting to see you do some thing like doug does    i like the fact that mclaren is open to working with a lot of youtubers   got a 570gt should be posting a video of it soon  had it for little over a year and kicking my self not doing bunch of videos   held off getting a 720 for some reason the 570gt got more attention then the 720 every time they next to one another  given using it for marketing to gain attention have to go with what is working  do not get me wrong the 720 does get a lot of attention just some reasons the 570gt got more  guess given more thought it was a p1 given they have very similar look to the average person   next plain to get the 600lt but still in the air  and the urus as well ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18006,i think the  tesla roadster on training wheels  thing was pretty unfair  let me explain    to start with  this mclaren is nothing less than a tesla roadster    a mclaren is not made for efficiency or being electric  is made to be very powerful all the time  and its better at that than the tesla will be    tesla will not be more nimble  light or aerodynamic  it will actually be much more heavy  and even more so if they dare put a gear set to make up for low power at high speeds  which is the whole point of a sports car    the point of the tesla is that it will be electric  for which there is nothing to learn from the mclaren    it is pretty disrespectful too if you consider this was unfair to the ones you partnered with  i give credit when credit is due and the video was good  but that was specially unfortunate  i understand you are hyped  but try keep your head cold marques ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18522,this video shows again how little he knows about cars like all his last car videos  his tech reviews are good but just reading the info sheet of a car and saying that you feel safer in an all wheel drive car isn t really a good review nor  features  list  he should stay with tech,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18523,he is getting there  gradually  how do i know  checkout his first tech videos  you would not watch them twice today  but he is up there today as a tech giant  best thing about tech and cars  it is evergreen  he is never ever going to run out of video fodder  so  go for it mkbhd ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18557,you should definitely do a give away for this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18558,actually  supercars are not necessarily designed to be the most drag efficient  that is for long range cars or to optimize efficiency  aka your tesla model s   the model s has the lowest drag coefficient of any other production car of around 2 3  supercars however  are designed to create downforce  as you mentioned earlier  however downforce creates quite alot of drag  thus lowering the top speed  you are correct that a 720s is much more drag efficient than 99 9  of cars  but the focus is definitely more on downforce rather than aerodynamic efficiency  to elaborate  in 1998  mclaren developed the  f1   not their f1 team  which had 610hp  down 110hp compared to the 720s  and weighed only 300lbs less  based on just those two numbers alone  some would assume the f1 s top speed is similar to that of the 720  but in 1998  mclaren was able to get their f1 to go 243mph  a record undefeated until the veyron came out in 2006  sure the extremely light weight of 2643lbs contributed to that  but the mclaren f1 is much more aerodynamically efficient compared to the 720s  and is able to achieve such a higher top speed  however  today s world of cars has top speed irrelevant  and the 720s would run circles around 99 99  of cars due to the developments in modern aero design and downforce   also mclaren s suspension is unreal ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18559,someone who actually knows their stuff  that is pretty rare these days  yes the f1 was designed to have a very minimal front face design so if could cut through the air hence the high top speed   the faster you go the heavier the air gets as you are essentially smashing though air at say 200mph  the less surface area at the front help combat this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18560,very nice  i remember when rowan atkinson totalled his f1  what a waste ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18561,the f1 is a surprisingly small car  too  it helps with drag but when you see one in person  you may be surprised ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18562,not to mention that paddle shifting is far faster than manuals now  when the f1 was out  automatics barely could keep up with supercar power levels  also tires have become so much better  max performance tires can flake off on corners to maintain grip ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
18563,great comment  was not the f1 designed by a computer program too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18572, tradingfeline its because youtube completely missed out major of the events of 2018 like paul vs ksi  logan forest video  tseries vs pew  pewdiepie opening video with  year review   and lots more plus they added sjw s if thts not enough,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18586,would definitely not put this car in the  tesla roadster training wheels category  if you are going to use it in regular traffic what difference will it make  if you are going to drive it seriously  then you have to start asking questions  like  how much is the tesla going to weigh over this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18845,two things   1  how on earth is the outside of the car being noticeably loud  a positive   2  were you parked at a handicapped spot  i doubt it but  that is all i could look at during those clips   those aside  i am glad this video was at least well made  this series has always left me confused with the things beings said and the quality being presented  the ladder seems to be fading  can t say much for the former ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

18850, thomasennss i feel you  like how some people enjoy the sound of the ocean or a forest  personally  i enjoy rain and the ambient noise of people talking  i guess i look at a car review from the point of view of someone being on the road near this car than someone looking to buy it  safety  environmentally friendly  and low noise levels are top priority for everyone else on the road not in this car  usually  like with all of these auto focus videos  though  it seems to take the perspective of the self centered driver  one i do not find inherently bad  but i do not share it and find it hard to empathize with ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19061,7 04 so not a great car for us introverts   i feel oneplus keeps screwing their customers by releasing a variant update just few months after each device  if i had bought the 6t  i would have regretted it because then they released the purple variant which i like better  then not long after  the mclaren version with faster charging and more ram  same with the op6 when they released the red version shortly after  at least that price increase will not make all those who bought the 6t regret it  just some of them  i still feel the op6 is the better value ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19062,doug looks different ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19063,i like your videos but you really have no clue about cars  or how to review them   listing off the numbers on the car really does not work as well as it does with phones  you need to talk about what engine and transmission setup it has etc  you say the shifting is fast but nothing more  i want to know what transmission it uses  why is it so fast   also  dynos are not accurate they are only for creating a reference point  and some dynos can read higher lower than others ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19686,it is  to this day   and counting ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19687,it is bumpy  it is rattly  when i want something i need to take 2 minutes on the screen  it is unreliable  bad build quality  cheap materials  a steering wheel that wobbles up and down when you move it  the top of the door wobbles  horrible brittle sound on the trim when you knock it  fabric on the bottom of the seats  not covered back cup holders in the armrest and covered with cheap plastic  when i put down the back armrest while in drive it makes a loud rattling sound  bad door closing sounds  cheap fabric speakers and part of dashboard which gets worn out quickly  the roof window gets orange in the sun  back seat shaking around while drive  back seat belts unsupported so they fall to the side any time you move  scratchy seat belt material  the backs of the front seats are covered with cheap scratchy plastic  old teslas had a manual opening storage in the centre console  new teslas centre console storage place is dangerous and can get your hand scratched and caught  back windows only go half way down  zero back window visibility  squeaky windows  loud cabin noise  barely any configuration choices  if you question me  i tell you that i test drove two teslas for myself  teslas should be  15 000    20 000 not  50 000  it just does not make sense  beware  tesla is a scam     add on  before i went for my test drive  it took me 5 minutes just to open it  i placed the card onto the door pillar where it was meant to be and it just did not open  tesla should just make a key for goodness sake and trying to be  unique  i do not want to take 5 minutes opening a car thank you very much  teslas are unique  uniquely bad ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19697,how does it not have a third head rest in the rear  i thought elon was going for safest car  but this just satisfies the standard test procedures  even a mild crash could snap an adult s neck in the middle seat  why would you not include a third headrest  i just do not get it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19710,marques   i ve been flying flacon 32 and here are my thoughts  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19711,great vid  they need to stop rushing product out   focus on quality control  are drivers able to create shortcuts for various controls like wipers and hvac ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19712,not power fold,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19713,this car has an ugly design  is pure steel and plastic  inside is so boring that makes me go asleep  the technology is maybe good  however  60k  for this car is insane  i would pay 30k for it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19714,only i love stevejobs i love apple   but you really awesome men ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19715,this is  long range car or perfomance car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19716,this guy will forever remain mark ass brownlee  as some sort of brownlee with a superior mark quality ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
19717,because this car completes the word s3xy,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19718, 9 10  and this is the one tesla gave me  well actually  looks like they gave you two  marques  i noticed a performance model and a long range model in the video ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19719,the 2021 performance model y does not have all those little issues he pointed out  love my model y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19723,low quality material is the reason i am not buying it in the near future ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19724,just way too expensive unfortunately  wish tesla would reduce their pricing a bit ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19814,marques is not picky about quality control  huh  that is strange   anyway  the elon musk sheep mentality is nuts  tesla is a garbage company and will sink  other car manufacturers are coming out with vehicles that will crush tesla s garbage they have pumping out  marques should know better  but he is going  so i can get what he is being so naive  still not a good look  edit  nope  i am sorry  this is not just naivet   can you imagine marques drooling over a phone that had buttons that were almost falling off  and a loose fitting frame that jiggled and let water and dust in  no  i cannot either  that is unless it had a telsla logo on the back  this is shilling of the highest order  i hope marques did not buy too much telsa stock  that company is going to fall hard just like everything else elon touches ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19939, mikac2002 you do realize that the stock price cannot be justified  it s clearly overhyped and since tesla is added to the s p 500 today  i d sell my shares if i were you  be happy about the strong gains and wait for the correction that s inevitable,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19940, thesakeable there is in my opinion 3 reasons why the stock is that high  first most of the smarts investors are buying for the long term like 2030  and they are not selling  so when people are buying a lot but not selling  the stock price goes down  second  it is a garantie that tesla will be worth more than 1 trillion in 2030  most tesla investors know that  and they are willing to pay any price to have this stock on there portfolio  cuz the stock price right now is going to look like a typo in many years  third literaly nobody knows how to propaly value this stock  its defenetly not a car company so you should not rank it has a car campany  tesla is a tech compagnie like apple  so you have to value it accordingly  but still basicly everyone do not know what metric to use to value the stock  for tranparency  i am very bullish on tesla and i have more than 60 shares now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19941, mikac2002 well  i am sorry but you do not sound like you know a lot about stocks or how value is generated  firstly  there is no guarantee for anything  secondly  how are you coming up with these numbers like 1 trillion dollar market cap and why by 2030  as you are comparing tesla to apple  just so you know  apple hat an ebit of  63 billion in 2019  while tesla had an ebit of    0 6 billion  a stock price has to be justified on the long run  because if it is not  you can be sure that the only thing driving the price is hype  and hypes die  as soon as fan boys start buying the stock it is definitely time to get out very quickly  i wish you the best and hope you do not lose too much ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
19942, thesakeable yeah your right  i do not know a lot about stock  but what i now is that since feburary of 2019 i have always been right about tesla and basicly all my predictions were right  the only prediction i was wrong is how much money i would do  i predicted maybe 50 000  but now i am at 71 000  if i sell all my shares witch i am not going to do cuz i am not braindead  peoples with average iq simply do not understand disruption and exponential growth  but i do  and when you do the future become all so clear  and yeah you don t start to like everything tesla does cuz you are a fan boy  you become a fan boy cuz you like what tesla is doing  big difference  this is the next amazon  but this time  i am just ahead of the curve ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

19944, danieljosephausten2662 1  english is not my first language and i grew up in a city in quebec that basicly nobody talks to you in english  2  i really do not give a fuck about spelling mistakes and perfect grammar  if you find my mistakes offending  that is really not my problem   3  i would love for you to talk to me in french my first language  without making any mistakes  i would find it very funny  so yeah i agree that i need to practice more my english  so while i continue to polish my english  please go and learn exponantial growth and disruptive technologies   and yeah since your refering iq  3 years ago i did a study on peoples with adhd  on the first day you would do an test that lasted 2 hours  it was basicly a really big and complexe iq test  and then for the next 4 months  play a little annoying game 5 days a week that was supposed to improove my attention  unfortunatly  there was no real coralation between playing the game and having a better attention  it would have been an ez way for peoples with adhd that did not have enought money to buy medications  to increase their attentions at school  the last day i did the same test again and when they provided the results  i saw that i had an iq of about 132 the first time and 137 the second time  i was  8 on 100 participants  yeah it was 3 years ago but i am pretty sure that if i do this test again i would have the same score or even better   have a nice day,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20009,very important message to marques and anyone that sees this  life it is not all about milk and honey but also about reading the word of god  having a relationship with him  he is spirit and he must be worshipped in spirit and in truth  the prayer is not a monologue  it is a dialogue  god speaks in a very soft voice when you keep quiet and focus on prayer and his word  the bible  we must be prepared for meeting him  tomorrow could be our last day  how do we prepare for this   first thing to do is repent of the sinful lifestyle if you practice it  2nd step  then welcome him by just an honest simple prayer from your heart like this   god  will you come into my life  i want to know you better    the third step would be to make a habit to pray daily  10 20 minutes  and read the bible regularly  you can start with the book of john in the bible  where it has the most informations about his personality  do not ignore this  this is the most important thing you could do in your entire life  you can have a relationship with god  have the promise of salvation and walk with him in this life  god bless you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20129,i love tesla cars  but those exact problems that you mentioned really bother me  if i had 70k to spend on a car i probably would not buy a tesla  just because of few quality problems and everything being controlled through the screen  the glove box for example  there could be a button that if you double tap it  like a screen on the phone  opens the glove box  and since they are going for a futuristic look  which i really like  they do not have to put a physical button ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20130,quite surprised of the low quality of some parts  nothing is perfect i guess,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20131,none of teslas are worth it   they are nothing but a fad for yuppies   when you factor in cost of the car you will never be in positive unless you use it professionally and drive it for 500k   considering that majority of people with money drive a car for maybe 20 30k then change them  it makes 0 sence unless they are tesla funboys   its like an iphone of cars where you can get something just as good for half price yet people still grab it and will defend their stupid decision till their last breath   in this model specifically  car is 70k   in this price range you can get a very nice car with better quality finish from luxury company   i mean porche macan costs 60k  throw in difference of 10k to cover gas costs and have 0 issues in winter ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20137,huge tesla fan  but get the panel gap issues fixed for christ s sake  they need to be going over every car with a fine tooth comb before it leaves the factory  every gap needs to be measured on every car until the problem goes away for a significant amount of time  if any gap is not absolutely perfect then they need to send it back to get fixed  these cars cost 70k  they re going to ruin a great product if they don t completely focus all their efforts on solving this problem  people in europe are switching the audi etrons  which is an inferior car by every metric  because build quality absolutely 100  matters  get on it already  i m writing this because i want tesla to succeed  tesla is the first american car to come out that isn t completely mediocre in the last 40 plus years  i don t want to see them sabotage themselves over something that can easily be avoided  fix it now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20143,over  50 billion in cryptocurrency flowed out of china over the past 12 months amid trade wars  a new study finds  east asia is the world s largest cryptocurrency market  its crypto trading volume is driven by  a robust professional market  as well as an  extremely active  retail market  the world s largest crypto market east asia is the world s largest cryptocurrency market  a new report from blockchain data analytics firm chainalysis shows  the region  which includes china  hong kong  macau  japan  mongolia  south korea  and taiwan  accounted for about 31  of all cryptocurrency transacted in the last 12 months  in an excerpt from its upcoming 2020 geography of cryptocurrency report  chainalysis explained that more cryptocurrency was sent from east asia than other regions to foreign addresses   over  50 billion traveled from east asia addresses to addresses in other regions  compared to just over  38 billion for western europe  the region next in terms of value sent out of the region   the firm revealed  most of the cryptocurrency outflow was from china  chainalysis added  noting that the chinese government only allows citizens to move an equivalent of  50 000 at the most out of the country each year  wealthy chinese have found some ways to circumvent the restrictions  such as via real estate and she will companies  but the authorities have been cracking down on these methods   cryptocurrency could be picking up some of the slack   the firm noted  elaborating  over the last twelve months  with china s economy suffering due to trade wars and devaluation of the yuan at different points  we ve seen over  50 billion worth of cryptocurrency move from china based addresses to overseas addresses ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20150,shows what a messed up capitalist world we live in  tesla  a tenth of the income of vw but worth more  yet tesla lost over half a billion   in one quarter recently  they are in big trouble  their quality control is nothing short of pathetic after all these years  when you spend so much on money on a car  you expect quality  not big gaps which will let water in  things potentially falling off etc  now that vw  mercedes and all the other big boys getting into the ev market  expect tesla to get crushed  remember  the much touted tech  software  from tesla can be replicated and improved  plenty of talented people who can do that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20151,i think elon just thought i have to make model 3 better or he just got lazy with the design and spun up model y  either of those led to model y which looks like a next generation of model 3 honestly,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20182,6 40 stop saying i do not know  i wish it had buttons  the fact is buttons make life much easier vs tapping multiple times on a screen  on a screen you cannot feel the virtual button  so you have to take your eyes off the road  just to operate something simple  to top it off  if your screen breaks there goes all your controls  how designers can get away without implementing physical buttons for windshield wipers  radio volume  channel is being cheap and criminal ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20195,it is easy for people to overlook some serious issues with tesla build quality all in the name of image and performance  but for this much money  i still think it should not have things like missing paint  prevalent on tesla 3s  misaligned gaps  panels  back seats interior pieces  and much more  to door handles not coming out or screens dying in the middle of driving so you cannot roll down the windows or turn on the windshield wipers  did i mention literally some pieces of plastic on the bumpers being so thin you can push it in with one finger or the trunk sensors that say the trunk or frunk are open when they are not  i am a huge tech fan  but a holistic tech fan  i have a note 10 and love it  but if the camera lens just started to loosen from the frame or buttons stopped working  i would be annoyed  if the glass back hand a distorted or missing finish  then it would be called a defect  not just a  build quality  issue  i still think i would eventually buy one and love the technology and performance  but maybe in 10 more years when they have matured to just getting the basics down   i am not willing to tolerate what most tesla owners are willing to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20211,apple s car project started with software and expanded to hardware  then they found themselves going into a rabbit hole  so they retracted the r d and focus soley on automation and other software development for car manufacturers before they themselves deciding whether or not they can make their own hardware  i would have to say this strategy makes a lot of sense  since apple always wanted to be in a field where they can control lots of the core technologies and seeking for high profit margin  this year s bmw was just a tap of market test  with risc based chips being ever more powerful  i think they are going to sell central control units instead of a car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20212,it makes no sense to remove the buttons for things  the centre touchpad seems awful  like yes having everything in one place is nice but it ruins the eyeline of watching your speedometer and moving all the vent controls to it seems like a step backwards  having overrides on the individual vents seems simple  i get tesla wants to appear as the car of the future but some of these features seem like change for change s sake rather than progress,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20400,i honestly agree with how the direction of the air conditioning being controlled by the screen is pretty annoying  and technically that would be more unsafe to readjust because of how you got to take your eyes off the road to readjust it while in a current standard car it is just a quick flick of it towards you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20411,i think you got it wrong two little things  at least  in model 3  a  there is a button for windshield wipers as well as for windshield washer  it is in the end of turn signal lever  b  you do not need to leave the key card in its place on the console  just show it to the car and put it back to your pocket   i believe these applies also for model y,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20413,bad quality  you just paying elin and for the batteries,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20414,the massive flaw with that roof is there is no sliding blind shade  in hot climates like australia you absolutely need to be able to physically block the light heat  having to change the wiper speed on the screen is dangerous  if you are driving in pouring rain and suddenly it gets much heavier you need to be immediately able to speed up the wipers not mess about in a menu and crash while trying to do that and see ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20426,there is this nagging question in the back of my mind   did elon go with such a polarizing design for the cybertruck  yes i reserved one  yes it is frigging ugly  but man is it freaking cool  just because he new it would make wave and get people talking about it  good or bad  yeah i know  duh  but think about it  or did he have another motive behind it as well  trucks  suv s and crossovers dominate auto sales  and passenger cars are losing market share every year  did elon pick such a striking  and stark  departure from the tesla design language for their truck so that it would be a  talking piece  a  lifestyle truck  and not drain away sales from potentially 60  of his product line  the s  3  and y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20462,that lack of physical controls for essential controls like windscreen wipers and air vents  i mean really  makes me not even consider ever buying one  the point of physical controls are that you never have to take off your eyes from the road ahead to use them  i think that putting everything on a touchscreen is a safety hazard  every second you have to look at the screen is a second you will miss ahead of you and that will just increase the risk for an accident ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20512,all of those tiny imperfections immediately turned me off from ever buying a tesla ouch,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20513,but the important thing is that they are improving  yes  their quality control is not on par with other cars in its price range  but it is much better than it was  say  4 of 5 years ago ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20514, rileyweaver 637 if the sun visor is falling off now and the tailgate has a panel gap as wide as panama canal and you say it has improved from 4 5 years ago  i do not know what it was 4 5 years ago,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20515, farbodniazi6504 that is because the car is new  any new car has various mistakes that get fixed over the years that model is produced  so obviously a  young  model will have more issues than the same model 3 years later  that is not unique to tesla,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20516,having bought audi for a while before teslas  the finish is the same quality  my model s was spotless  early model 3 had a quirk  but had a8 with loose panels misaligned door and loose stitching on the seats  which made me fairly annoyed ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20585,7 45 i have seen a red toyota prius just ahead of the red tesla being driven  though this does not make sense most people do not see it  the prius is a big competition against tesla for the many people who want to go green  get exempted from some car related taxes and still fill up the tank in less than five minutes instead of 45  minutes at a lower purchase cost ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20622,i want  i neeeed  i ve heard about the quality control issues before  but that was pre model 3  kind of makes you wonder if tesla cares at all  and i don t want to spend a lot of money on a car that supposed to be reliable but really isn t  i feel like on teslas everything but  the drivetrain  will break  also there supposed to be more for middle income buyers and those buyers still care about reliability and repair costs over time ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20623,no video like why i buy a model y    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20624,do you think these hi tech feature in tesla cars are just experiments for the future bigger plans elon is making  with these futuristic vehicles  people will even unknowingly pay for being the part of test products ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20625,tesla purposely did not put a  key holder  to encourage you to use your phone instead  additionally having no key holder encourages you to put your key card back in your pocket so you do not forget it in the car when you leave  everything else said is accurate but the same that every other reviewer has said  performance  features  and specs are top notch but build quality and qc can definitely improve ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20626,my biggest dislike with tesla is the quality  the interior is bad  lots of rattle and road noise  panels and stuff missaligned  does not feel like a 75k car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20640,having a card be the car key is such a genius idea  all keys in the world should be on cards  just put it in your wallet purse and head out  genius ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20641,that card key idea is so genius  car keys are a completely new thing you have to carry with you  why not just have your car key be a card that you can just put in your wallet purse  you re going to take it anyways  so mine as well make the key be something apart of what you already carry around  instead of a new  sharp  sometimes heavy thing  genius ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20642,change that granny style steering wheel put a normal speedo cluster on the dash and assemble the car better also step up the paint job   to be honest teslas are expensive because of the tech you find in the car not coz of the overall quality of the vehicle ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20649,hey marques  i really appreciate all your videos and i always loved how your content always aligned with your video title  your last two videos have really weird title names  which are pretty clickbaity and not like i am used of your quality channel  in this video you did not even dress the question which is in the title imposed  the other video ist your new video about the one plus nord and its  truth  it was a pretty casual review and there was no breathtaking truth to take away  my only complain is could you go back to the way you phrase the title less clickbaity  that is what i always appreciated the most in your channel ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20652,just hope their quality has improved ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20653,i m not going to lie  even though i like tesla this is a very ugly car with poor design aesthetics  the interior is a complete disaster  extremely poor quality in the details and in the materials used  especially when selling for 70k  for the price i would rather go for a regular mercedes or bmw over this one  even though performance might be amazing  the average buyer for that price range would definitely pay attention to those kind of aspects as well as comfort and looking for a bit of status too  so going for a more established brand would be a no brainer for most of them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20659,the interior is so minimal  that it s boring ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20660,it is going to be really interesting to see how well tesla addresses these quality issues   in terms of manufacturing quality and also the general materials and finishing   as mainstream competitors catch up  if you are currently driving an audi and been treated by those interiors it would seem a bit disappointing to spend more to get a lesser experience  in these respects  obviously people can choose what they value  but when you are already paying a lot of money it is a shame to have to  in real world use  i think many consumers would give up some of the range  speed and even the awesome tech of a tesla to have a more premium feeling car with rock solid reliability and build  the great news is that it is not a zero sum game   just like legacy auto manufacturers are finally giving us interesting evs because of tesla  telsas will hopefully get better at doing the bread and butter quality stuff ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20661,my best topic on your channel,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20662,no ads for tesla  to create the hype  just send review units to influencing youtubers and they will take care of convincing the stupid to pay all that money for a car that is not built to respect the customer  those fit and finish things mkbhd showed are just the visible ones  only god knows what is hidden ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20664,legacy man  panel gaps          ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20665,the only button you miss in this car  is that of the glovebox  no other buttons are needed  is my experience after driving it for 8 months ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20666,i get what you mean by being less about panel gaps and more about the car driving experience  but the thing you need to remember about quality control is it applies to the working parts and mechanics too  so longevity needs to be considered  how much will you love the car  regardless of how it drives  if its constantly got problems  especially when its well documented that tesla will tie themselves in knots to not have to remedy any issues they have created   also  some of the  rich rebuilds  experience has to be taken into consideration  some great cars out there but if customer service is atrocious  owning one can be a burden ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20667,trucks have had fuel card holders for even since i can remember  surely cannot be too hard for tesla to do a similar thing for the key card ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20678,7 20 once you enter the car with your card key  you do not need to place the card anywhere special to start drive the car and go  you can literally just put it back in your pocket  as i do ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20679,i cannot wait for marques to go to studio and say  it is time we put the car to test around our race track that means handing it over our racing driver   some says he was was holding his mothers hand to comfort her when she was giving birth to him   all we know is he is linus ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20680, the stuff that i pay attention to that matters  i would say build quality matters a lot on a review sample too  unless it is explicitly said that the review sample is not finished and needs more work  which is something that then should be disclosed in the beginning of the review overwiev  i would say panel gaps have a lot to say on a product especially if they are so big that there is water getting into the cabin  it will affect how the car ages  water in a modern car with so much electronics  that is terrifying  to small panel gaps are no bueno either because then you will chip paint and run the risk of rust  these are problems you cannot look away from on a review sample tesla because those are problems that have been on both the tesla x and model 3  do not let features take away from the actual quality of a product ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20700,a dream would be a tesla with basic physical buttons and the standard of building cars like we have here in germany or switzerland  i ve never seen so many quality issues ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20701,those manufacturing issues are going to be a big problem if they do not fix them  once someone has had their  100k car for a few years with constant minor issues  they are going to try a mercedes or audi and jump ship  we can all talk the talk but can most of us afford one  not at these prices  think about the non tesla fan boys who can just want a sweet car  i cannot see then sticking with the brand if they do not fix these issues ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20715,they just lowered the price on model y by  3 000  so is the  70k before or after the recent price reduction ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20716,suv coup s are bullshit though  every one of them packs only the negative characteristics of the coup   limited space and visibility  and the negative side of the suv  being bulky and un economic together  and they re ugly  other than that  the model y is fine  but tesla should do something useful  a wagon  like for example the audi a4 or a s rs 6 wagons ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20739,marques  the key is not supposed to sit on the centre console  you tap it with nfc to start to drive  then can throw it back in your pocket  you have had it for 2 weeks ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20740,8 mins in  and i already know there is no way i will ever own a model y   also  these physical problems cannot be made better by their software engineers   it is like a programmer  aka elon  designed a car   have you tried your touchscreen with gloves on   i bet you cannot adjust your vents with gloves on  your  key  yeah  just get the app  how about just get another car   one where they bothered to be  refined  like other manufacturers have been doing since the 30 s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20741,this thing would be so much better if they made it an actual wagon  so much wasted space in these  suv s  with the slanted hatch  triggers me every time i see an x4  x6  etc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20742,i understand not being picky  but the panel gap on the roof is seriously unacceptable  i do not expect that from a dacia that cost 14 000 or whatever  that is just pure laziness from someone  does not cost anything to assemble something properly ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20745,good job and some critics   marques  you are an excellent tech reviewer but need to work on angle of the camera in the car  for instance  when you talking about glossy armrest you may show us  its also nice to see the dash when you drive  carwow is an excellent car reviewer  maybe can get some inspirations ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20748,cannot wait to see your review on the actual cybertruck  i suggest an offroad review   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20749,the only control i would prefer back in physical form is the wiper controls  looking away from the road  in already less then ideal circumstances  to adjust their speed is bad  even just adding the possibility for voice commands for this kind of stuff would be good   other than that  they are fine on the screen  after a couple months of driving the same car  i usually set up all the knobs and switches how i like them  and then very very rarely touch them again  anyway ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20750,lol  you do not have to leave the keycard laying there on the center console to drive  you just tap it and then the car unlocks  that is just used as a backup key  the main key for the car is your phone  same as the model 3 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20751,all this is great  but that new ford bronco  so damn nice ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20752,it is crazy how if it was any other company  people would go ape shit about misaligned body panels  fish eyes in the paint and interior pieces that are not installed properly falling out  yet when its tesla  it always gets a pass  i would not expect this kind of disregard for quality control on a 30k car  yet alone a car that costs 70k usd ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20753,your intro with the outline of the model y front end coming at you before your brand was awesome ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20761, atombender you re really only paying for performance which is going to catch up to tesla at some point i like tesla hate the fans like the brand though but they ignore huge issues at some point people are just going to drop 70gs on a used 5 series or 718 most tesla enthusiasts aren t the ones buying cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20762,nomiki konst did a good video on tesla  very critical  these are the pros and cons of their strategy to get cars out as soon as possible to be first to market  and refine their  cars later ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20763,overall it s a bigger better model 3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20766,electric bs,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20767,something that i wish tesla had to the point where i wonder if it can be modified to have this  a way to be able to slide and hide the huge screen away in the dash if you do not want to see it and leave a few basic buttons in this position for climate   seat heating   a heads up display with basic data  speed  battery consumption  and directions arrows for nav  that will make it a simple and beautiful dash  and if you want the huge screen you can just slide it back on,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20768,tesla needs to stop pretending its a startup  its a multi billion dollar company that makes cars  the production quality is a joke  most of the ytubers who review the tesla skip that part,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20769,yeah probably a nice car  but where is our right to repair it  just watch rich rebuilds for some info on how bad the situation with tesla is  these are like apple products  as in they are consumables  it dies  you buy a new one  that is not alright in general  let alone with a car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20770,cool review  but one thing missing  why does almost no review ever talk about voice controls  it is a major feature that simplifies allot of functionality in a modern clean interface like this    set temperature bla bla    open glove box   navigate to bla bla   open trunk   turn on wipers   play bla bla song   open xyz menu   call bob   text bob bla bla  etc   piece of cake  they turned a single button on the steering wheel into a cluster of knobs without the silly  bomber cockpit  clutter ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20782,i really enjoy mkbhd s videos  however i have a hard time watching the tesla clips  it is almost like propaganda for telsa  there are a pile of issues with telsa  yet their value keeps climbing  it almost seems   fixed  why support a company that could care less about it is customers  ever tried to insure a tesla  or repair one  tesla is about it control  and only control  my recommendation to mkbhd is to dig deeper   read between the lines  for the price  why the model y so ugly  looks like a slug bug reject  especially for a car that starts at  52 900   and finally  how is it safe taking your eyes off the road to fumble with a touch screen to change the windshield wiper speed ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20791,you are not picky about the  little stuff  that does not bother you  things like panel gaps or pieces not being attached properly  how do you have confidence in the rest of the vehicle  if they could not even be bothered to make sure a panel fits on the car properly  how do you know that a brake caliper will work under stress  that the airbag will deploy  more importantly what about autopilot which takes control of the entire car  quality control is a serious issue that goes far beyond an annoying sound or gap ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20792,y  is it their most important  giggles furiously,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20793,also fit and finish has been similar to many cars we have owned  would be interesting to have any vehicle survive the gauntlet tesla s must run,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20795,for  70k  it should not be falling apart right when you arrive    i think for that kind of money you should be picky about quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20800, huzygaming7216 it is progress from an auto manufacturer that is relatively young  on that note  i am surprised by the lack of detail    inb4 tesla licenses motor and auto tech to mercedes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20806, pauiiewalnuts not really  tesla will stay like this  they do not really have to give a fk about customers opinions  the only thing they have to take care is to lower the cost down  so that even you hate it you still buy it  customers are dumb and picky and cannot see the big picture and always stay on some unnecessary little details  they may not make right decisions by themselves  good manufacturers should not listen to customers  but lead customers to choose the right thing same as fk customers up  and tesla is the only company here has balls to fk dumb customers up  i am glad to see that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20816, monkeydluffy60073 your re in an comment section about an cars appearance  and you say that the speed argument is weak ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20817, stefthorman8548 i fail to see how speed is related to a car s appearance in any way  also  people talk about speed like omg this car can go 0 60 in 0 2 seconds  uhh  and why do i want that  lol  yes  the argument is weak  and i continue on saying that in a  car s appearance comment section ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20818, monkeydluffy60073 both are superficial  but the appearance is far more superficial  when people are saying omg that  luxury car brand  have an new and better paint and the shape of it is cooler  so its better  it makes you think what does that have to do with anything  so yes i wonder why you think the appearance is better then the content ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20819, stefthorman8548 because the content has no use  it literally serves no purpose lol  how is that so hard to grasp  unless you do not follow the law  speed does not matter  if companies said that cars brake from 60 0 in   then that would actually mean something  appearance is in fact more important than speed unless you are not a law abiding citizen or you are a racer  because unlike speed  you looking at the car and seeing how beautiful it is  can be something significant or of value ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20820, monkeydluffy60073 then what about it is safety features  i heard it is far more safe then most of it is competitors  and it looks pretty slick ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20847, tfgamess audi definitely better like 100  mercedes also better if you take just siting in the car and driving  porcshe miles better just bit expensive  if you look at the tech yes one would argue some things are better but as a car overall  nah tesla is not the best,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20854, huzygaming7216 lmao tesla are only fast in 1 4 mile  in any 1 2 miles race it gets trashed  now imagine in most situations you are not going to be done after just 1 4 mile are you  any prolonged high speed driving and the car easily overheats  why have not you seen any nuburgring lap records made by tesla yet  self driving cars being the future is another over promised statement by mr musk  it is useless now and only good to get you arrested  now imagine you are driving with autopilot  there have been many cases of the autopilot errors where it does not recognise the scenario and let us the driver take over  however  as with all the autopilot users they never pay attention to the road and when it is time to take over they are not even aware of the situation  you end up killing someone on the road and who is fault is that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20855, 8traceur90 1  i have never needed to get in a 1 2 mile race  simply because the roads are not capable of that here in sweden   not even straight line wide roads  high speed driving for long periods of time is also illegal in every country   even germanys autobahn has unrestricted zones but not always unrestricted  i mostly use 0 100km h and maybe 0 150 sometimes  2  i have driven on smaller tracks here in sweden and no overheating issues  check mishas model 3 video on the nurburgring and you will see the battery only gets too hot at the end of a whole run and that maybe cuts power by maximum 10  and cools down quickly  3  because tesla has not cared about the ring until recently  now the plaid model s prototype did a 07 13 in testing and we might see some ring times when it gets released  4  by todays rules  the driver is responsible regardless  people will do stupid shit  but fact is that autopilot is 10x safer than cars without autopilot  i have used it for 5 years and it works awesome ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20904,is it smart to make something harder to do for the sake of adding technology to it  if something is going to require me to press 3 buttons instead of one and at the same time me me take my eyes off the road  it is not an improvement  the point of technology is to make things more efficient  add both  have the mechanical buttons there for muscle memory and one touch access and the virtual settings for automaticity  make the windshield wipers button a step up step down button so the mechanical aspect does not  interfere with the programming and the virtual memory ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

20917,love the car  really nice ride ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20918,the main flaw with screen controls is that you cannot use them without looking and menus take longer  driving regular cars with buttons to turn on ac adjust volume via knobs cannot be beat cz once you have the muscle memory after using the buttons for a good time  you can just click them without looking and there are no menus to go through  cannot do that with a screen  no matter for how many months or years you use it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20919,a complete lack of tactile physical buttons and gauges is not only non ergonomic  in terms of number of actions needed to achieve a particular goal  but also simply dangerous  forcing you to take your eyes off the road  unnecessarily   longer  it is a terrible fad and i hope it goes away ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
20920,thank you for showing how the air vents can be controlled  i have been worried about that ever since i reserved a cybertruck  when i drive i need to feel the air blow on my face so my senses agree  seeing that i am moving while not feeling the wind on my face raises my anxiety some  i am still worried that i will not be able to use autopilot  i am someone who cannot have anyone else drive   i have to be in control  that means i cannot use taxis  busses  trains  or planes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21068,this car is quite ugly for 70k    usually really like teslas but the design missed on this one i am going to  also it s natural to like haptic feedback from levers  switches  buttons and knobs  it doesn t make sense to me why tesla would take this away from drivers and leave the interior looking barren like an unfurnished room in the process ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21196,nobody should be buying this car with this quality issues   70 k oh my god ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21197,the key cards does not need to stay there   its just  a contact key like on a hotel door you can keep it anywhere else   inclusing on your person   i carry mine in my wallet and use the phone app all the time   i have only had to use it once when something went wrong with my phone access app   great review though  keep up the great work,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21198,excellent review   imho  a jaguar i pace is far and away a better car and same price ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21199, i wish there was a place to hold the key   me  like a keyhole lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21200,haha  or your pocket  i do not know why there is a large amount of people that think you have to keep it there  maybe on screen instructions need to be clearer,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21201, mlmm  mmm       mmm m m   m,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21202,keyless entry should allow for keeping it in pocket or some sort of magnetic holder where the ancient keyholes used to go ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21203,yeah  about that key  that placement is only just to start the car  it is not supposed to be left on the console  once the car is operational  you can put the key anywhere inside the car  i have been in and drove about 140 tesla 3s  the key is really only supposed to be used if someone is borrowing your car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21204,7 30 so once you  start  the car using the card key it does not need to stay there  place it down  car is started  put it back in your wallet  done ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21205, ericanderson3534  marques brownlee also  if you enter the car using the key and not the app  and start driving straight  you do not need to show the key to the center console at all  only if you idle long enough around the car  change driver etc  using the keycard entering the car will allow you to start the car just by pressing brake pedal ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21206,i wish there was a place in this video to put his answer on why it is their most important car lol  i like the unbiased review though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21207,they keycard does not have to stay on the arm rest console to drive the car   it only has to placed there to start the car  then it can be put away,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21208, ugoboy32 difficult to put it into your pocket after you have sat down though  maybe a gap between the panels inside the car could be used   like stuff it in the gap above the hazard switch   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21209, chasecorpus9181 my phone slips out of my pocket when i am sitting down  would not want that happening with a key card  it is also really nice to have empty pockets on a long drive,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21216,upload your nord video i have to pre order it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21217,fit and finish is atrocious for the price  to say nothing of the far lower end cars you can purchase that are without those problems  tesla has got to stop having basics like this as caveats to their otherwise lovely vehicles  this idea that you have to choose either fit and finish or  sporty handles well  is so silly ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21218,he pointed out quality flaws and then spent a good 2 minutes explaining and reiterating why it does not matter too much  even ended the video on that note   its like when you talk about your best friend who happens to be a shitty person at times  you end with  but he is good at heart  kind of disappointing coming from someone who talks about build quality so much ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21234,hello mkbhd i wanted to ask you a question i asked this question in the mac pro vedio desk setup but you did not respond this question is about apple pro display xdr  it is how did you connect airpods to the apple pro display xdr  because have blue tooth headphone connection,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21235,kind of looks like the ford mustang electric model   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21236,audio     not up to mkbhd level ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21237,it surprised me when he said that he didn t care as much for those small details  for me personally  those small details along with the drive is very important ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21238,he did not pay for the car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21239,timo okello why does that matter  he said it s their  most important car  and for that price  there should be very little defects with the car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21240,moonface i m not trolling ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21241, winctech he said he does not care if he paid for it he would care  is not that simple enough to understand ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21242,i could ever buy a car where the window do not go all the way down in back  yes  ocd ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21243,timo okello so you re saying he shouldn t care just because he paid for it even though it is a review ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21244, winctech tesla gave him the vehicle for free anyone who paid their hard earned money on the vehicle would care for the smallest of defects on the vehicle   that is the difference i was trying to highlight ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21245,timo okello when you are making a review you should care about the small details because the entire purpose is to help people make a purchase decision  and tesla didn t give him a model y for free  he only got it for review not to keep ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21246, winctech he mentioned that he got it for free i assumed he was given free of charge   he had to review the vehicle as is to give his audience an unbias opinion  he stated that the defects were so minor that it would not bother him that is his prerogative  you on the other hand can worry about every detail if you wish it is your right ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21247, winctech you could assume his point was that he is not dedicated to car reviews enough to go into that much detail  he  does not care  to get that deep into reviewing  it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21248,timo okello i do not know about you but i think it s normal to worry about small details on a  50k  car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21285,you do not need to keep the key card on the the console area  it is just a tap and done  also there is a manual button for the windshield wipers  left signal stick,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21286,moving the controls to a touch screen makes it a major hazard  you cannot do it by feel  you cannot do it fast  which means  you will spend more time with your eyes off the road ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21324,i never spend my money on american  vehicles because of poor quality control and cheap material ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21325,i want the youtube rewind 2020 to start with marques saying   so i have been using youtube for a decade now  and here are my impressions ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21326,you would be very wrong the 3 is the car that is winning all the awards the y is not winning anything  i can see the ugly of the y from any distance the the model 3 from 356 degrees to 4 degrees even the model 3 is not attractive but from 5 degrees all the way to 355 degrees the model 3 is gorgeous  the y on the other hand looks like a blow fish or the love child of miss piggy and kermit the frog those over sized side windows make it look like a clown car or something from cars the movie but yest with all that glass the y has the most dangerous blind spots in its class,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21327,tesla  s 3 x y  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21328,i like everything about a tesla just the finish of the car is meh for that price  can get better finishing for the same price of an s3  a35 or some other cars        so i guess till then  stick with petrol cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21329,this guy s content quality is phenomenal  one of my favourite tech creators ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21330,would love mkbhd to do a auto focus review of the new polestar 2 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21332,not a fan of having everything on the screen  minimalism at the cost of convenience ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21333,why not make a tesla hatchback for the european market  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21334,the sound is not in the usual quality  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21335,liked just for the intro only before even going to the content  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21336,awesome car but ever noticed that all the teslas exterior design is ugly af and especially the front ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21337,i wish they sell teslas in my country,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21338, marcus brownlee thanks for another interesting video  i found it surprising how  wet  the sound recording was  i guess it must be the  gigantic  glass surfaces and the interior with relatively small amount of textile and  padding  all in all it sounded a bit like it was recorded in an  unfurnished room with hard floor  a bit unusual for  car audio  i m o ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21339,7 24 made me chuckle,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21340,that central screen and the  clean  dash would be enough to not want to buy one  what a terrible design ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21341,interior quality is really bad as always they need to improve,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21342,since model y is so simular to model 3  model 3 is their most important car for the big public ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21343,backstreet boys  tell me  if tesla model  y   is a good car or not  marques  say no more ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21344,new owner of a new model y opens trunk for the first time   sup guys  mkbhd here aaaand i have been in here for quite a while now  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21345,cheap and expensive,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21346,i like how this video is unbiased  knowing marques is a tesla fan  i appreciate him showing the panel gaps and stuff and talks about the disadvantages ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21347,i have always found marques to be horribly biased towards tesla because he is such a fan  this video is seems to be a bit more journalist  which i appreciate ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21348, ryandsz yeah to be honest this car looked kind of shit in terms of quality and he did not answer his question of it is importance,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21349, matthew yeah  i think most of there cars have amazing build quality and i figure this one will too given time  but for now this model looks too rushed to be released ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21350, matthew tesla is basically an ai battery company that happens to make cars  all their bleeding edge tech is in the battery pack  the bms  the tms  autopilot  power train  that kind of stuff  that is mostly what you are paying for  the build quality of the model y is not terrible by any means unless you want a luxury car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21351, sbmphr calm down fanboy,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21352, soumilsahu if i am going to pay 70k  then yes i want luxury build quality  and in terms of bleeding edge  porsche is at least developing new technology for the batteries,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21353, dnzry2218 like i said  most of that money comprises the tech  you can very well buy a 40k version  edit  i am not justifying the problems  we as customers should push a company to do better  i am just telling you that the price of a tesla ev cannot be compared on the same scale as a cv  they are different products ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21354, sbmphr those 100 y o car brands release new models each year  so they do get panel gap issues poor application of spoiler poorly anchored sun visor bad usability in car  but most do not have all those problems at once  to be fair i suspect these issues will be ironed out quickly due to machine learning  the rest of your comment is just blind assumptions insults ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21356, matthew 70k is not the base price wtf  it is 40k   70k is almost maxed out  also  do your research before spreading misinformation  the model y is not a luxury sedan  the statement  teslas are luxury sedans  is fallacious because tesla makes semi trucks too  their flagship car is the model s   i have mentioned this so many times already but i will say it again  you cannot gauge evs and cvs on the same scale  i understand that is not something that the end user cares about  since all they want is a car  but if we are having this argument  it is not something that can be ignored either ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21357, matthew i mean  sure if you feel there are better evs at the same price  that is totally fine  fair enough  i would love to know which ones though  since i am guessing  this is my fanboy coming out lol  that if they have better build  their performance will not be nearly as good as a tesla  given whatever little i know about their powertrains and battery technology but your last point has nothing to do with  the practicality of any ev  they could very well use analog controls if they wanted to   it is the same as when we were shifting to touch screen phones and all the old people went  where are my buttons  using a screen is simple shit  it is just a matter of what one generation is used to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21358, matthew to be honest tesla is the most targeted car company for their panel gaps panel gaps  one of my cousins who lives in england has aston martin vantage that has panel gaps so bad that it can fit a tooth paste between it my porsche has bad panel gaps aswell,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21359,matthew model 3 and y are spartan and probably very cheap to build with such a minimal interior  but tesla can get away with charging more because it s  unique ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21450,cinnamon rage don t assume   try driving one first   you don t miss it at all in fact is easier to see than the hud which is often blocked by the steering wheel  the speed is clearly visible on the monitor and ev doesn t have rpm,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21452,sejal patel equally you also can t assume that everyone is ok without it  i had a yaris from  07 where the screen was in the middle and it definitely required you to turn your head more  and in relation to steering wheel blocking  i have a heads up display  i d live without the main driver gauge if i had a heads up display  mine shows directions  speeds  cruise control there without me looking away from the road  make them options that cost more of it s currently a cost saving measure  why must everyone have to have the same stuff  you save money and don t buy it if it doesn t work for you and i ll buy it if i prefer having one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21473,shilly,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21474,tesla hardware wise sucks  imagine software wise  how buggy that car is  i bet those 90 mph crashes we have seen on tv is a software bug that shows that the driver speed up to 90 mph when the computer malfunctioned   and tesla knows about it and does not mention it to the public  why do you think tesla cars requires constant updates ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21475,man they sure did rich dirty though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21476,i would argue that dedicated buttons and movable vents would be safer overall than a screen and ui  because you develop muscle tactile memory of where all the controls are  what is basically a tablet on the dash would distract me too much  maybe the sweet spot would be a mix of both ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21507,maybe the model y is different  but in my model 3 you do not have to keep the key card on the center console  you just need to tap it there to  turn the car on  and then it goes back in your pocket bag cubby etc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21508,integrating so many controls into one screen seems like a bad idea  i know a lot of people mentioned that if the screen gets broken there is the option of voice control but that might require you to memorise many voice commands or the digital assistant might not be able to accurately understand what you say because of your accent or some other reasons  also  the whole roof being a glass panel might create some issues  there does not seem to be any way to cover that panel so on a sunny day would the inside of the car get hotter from direct sunlight  what if you leave it parked outside in the sun for hours  then there are the safety issues of how that panel would react in case of accidents and how strong it would be if the car turtles ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21540,you could at least actually give the answer to the question in the title  it is only one sentence and well  it is the title  the reason why the model y is their most important model is because crossovers are the trend now  they outsell sedans by a mile  and that makes the model 3 less competitive in today s market  sure  they have got the model x  which is even better  but also too expensive for people to buy it en masse  also it is a great car  but it does not nail it like you said  the interior is pretty cheap for the price  it is honda level  the screen is also not that cool since you need a couple clicks on the screen just to adjust the damn vents  it is a cost cutting measure  because it is cheaper to order screens from china than to put in buttons  i would not expect such cost cutting in such an expensive car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21578,marques  i appreciate the work and the great look you have for your gadget computer camera phone reviews  they look gorgeous  this auto focus series does not look as good or give that crispy  gorgeous look and feel  right away i noticed the audio was off  i know a car is not the same controlled environment of a studio but  it seemed really off  i cannot quite say what it is  but  it was less than that what you usually put out  the video also  was odd  the hand held work when you were talking about the exterior of the car was great but  the in car as you were driving shots were kind of uninteresting  it was strange  doug demuro who you talk about  his aesthetic is low end and kind of basic that he can get away with like super basic footage inside the car  this felt like you were trying to make something really good looking but  it just did not stick the landing  this is all to say  i am sure you are going back and looking for places to improve  i do not know  maybe take a stab at top gear s approach to the car  a bit more drama  less just pure almost clinical clean looks at the car  more emotionality in presentation  also  the backdrop where you shot the car  was really kind of well  ugly  the industrial park did not really inspire much in the video  or rather it was not used much or well  the building in construction had all of these hard rusted straight lines in the i beams  that might contrast with the curves of the car  it was also near some water  something where the car is overlooking the water might be nice  it just did not have you usual flair  anyways  thank for all the hard work you have put into all of these videos for decades now  i am sure the next one is going to be even better than this one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21579, i just want to put the air on my face  too perfect    it may sound stupid  but this is why i would never buy a tesla  as is  tactile buttons for common activities are important to me  vents  radio  climate control  lighting  cruise control  do not get in my way with menus and a screen i need to look at to see what i am doing  distracted driving and detracts from the fluidity of the ux   other american manufacturers tried to pack too many things into their touch interfaces in the mid teens  too  few years later  the buttons were back   kiss  you all  i just want to point the vent at my face ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21580,apparently you do not own a smart phone then   it is literally one tap and a drag and you can move the air wherever you would like   oh  and if you want to increase the speed just push the button on the steering wheel and say  increase fan speed  or  fan speed 7   there is a button on the stalk for cruise control and it is the same one to activate autopilot   all of the other functions you mention can also be controlled by voice command   no looking for any button ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21581, dcvide0s  my experience is after a few days driving a car  i do not look for common buttons  i instinctively know where they are and have tactile feedback to confirm without looking away  vents are a great example of that kind of direct tactile feedback  pressing a button and then speaking a command is also not as instantly gratifying as simply pressing a button if i am doing it often   voice and touch interfaces have definite utility flexibility  for my tastes it is overdone by tesla  is all  ymmv ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21582,oliver klosov except tesla s voice commands suck and just like any voice command can be frustrating to use  it s silly to use voice command to adjust fan vents to hit your face  tesla fanboys are something else ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21585,tim m totally agree  i read some article some years back that the military was switching from digital controls back to analogue because the electronic controls were too distracting  a couple months later  i read that they started using xbox type controllers for their tanks  i ll have to look into it more  and i m not sure where you can get reliable info about this  so don t take my word for it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21586,yea  it takes three presses to turn on the windshield wipers is just stupid  in a normal car i would just move my finger a bit and switch it on but here i have to look at the screen  find the setting  select a speed and then go out of the menu  all that while going at 70mph down the road  most cars have a feature where you can just wipe the windshield once if there is some dirt or something that i need to remove  but here it is a chore going to the menu and turning it on  then off and requires my attention that i should be giving to the road instead,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21587, timm7524 i had this issue too before i bought one  you get over it and it actually becomes more confusing to use buttons once you get have been using the screen  i have also had someone else driving my car for months and they had the exact same experience  so do not even consider it an issue  whichever one you use more recently is what your brain prefers  what he did not mention in the video is the car learns so after a few adjustments the windshield wipers will learn what you prefer and you never touch it again no matter what the rain snow is doing  everything else is set it and forget it   cruise control  is pretty much the same as a gas car  just push the drive stalk up ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21588, horseradish843 actually you there is a button on the left stalk that you press or hold in to use the wipers just like a gas car  also  unlike any other car  it learns as you do this so your automatic wiper becomes better until you never have to adjust it for rain snow again  mkbhd did not seem to know about this  but i just found out my friend did not know her lexus of 6 years had cruise control so people just do not know this stuff until someone tells them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21591,50 000 miles on a model 3 later  it is really  really not a big deal  wipers can be activated for a single swipe with a button on the stalk  and only perhaps a half dozen times have i needed to override the auto setting  the air vents just take a quick tap and drag and isn t really that often of a change  and i live in balls hot and sunny florida  the audio system is a quick tap of a channel and then everything else is the thumb wheel on the steering wheel  cruise autopilot is a stalk plus steering wheel  if you only watch reviews  sure it might seem a little foreign but live with it and you very quickly see the advantages and simplicity  and it becomes just as natural as any other car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21592, horseradish843 first of all  the wipers are rain sensing  so it normally takes 0 button presses   if you want an occasional wipe due to mist  there is a physical button on the end of the turn signal stalk you can push lightly for one wipe and harder for wash   lastly  if you must have manual control of the wipers  it is only two presses on the screen   it works perfectly well without any drama ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21593,i felt that way at first when i was researching tesla  but after driving my model 3 for 4 months now  you adapt and i never ever think about it  the only button i wish they had was one for the glove box ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21671,i do not like the mic audio on this one  sounds so  tinny ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21672,the screen would be an issue for me also  when things are manual you can adjust them without looking  keeping your eyes on the road  when you have to use the screen you can become distracted  besides what happens when the panel fails ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21673,everything is voice activated  hr may be new to this car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21674, rickkay9548 how many languages does voice control support ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21675, rickkay9548  we can still have both though  i do not want to have to speak out loud to turn the volume or fan speed up and down while driving  especially if others are with me  and a knob let us me hear feel the change as i make it  so i can dial in preference on the fly and purely by feel ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21676,jcube i believe every language where it is sold  more later  not sure the total support scope though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21677,tim m yep  me too  the knobs on the wheel work wonders for volume and sound control  i would love to be able to customize what functions the wheel controls work with  but the defaults are pretty good so far ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21678,its not an issue  once you get used to the screen you will be doing the same thing and you will suddenly find all the myriad of buttons in a gas car confusing  for new drivers i have found it is simpler to learn the touchscreen  i still know people who do not know what half the buttons in their 6 year old car does  d,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21679,love the fact that the car probably has 20 lbs less plastic i can learn to adjust,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21680,jamaican tesla driver the screens are still really laggy my aunt has a model 3 and the speedo glitches and stays on a certain  speed even though the car is stopped i ve seen alex choi having the same issue,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21681, josephshamon7824 that definitely sounds like a warranty issue  the screen should not have any lag especially not freezing  never saw that on any of the model 3s i know  but shit happens for sure ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21686,it s a 60k or a 100k vehicle   it s apples and oranges ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21687,oh that is what they complained about the horse and buggy before  dirt flying over and inside  when your competing against the legacy the first problem is to gain advantage on the area which they ignore  safety and usability for people with disabled or just old  its not just for a targeted market  hell one day a kid could just press a button like bring to dad or say bring me to school ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21688,it is worrying how many reviews of the my are coming out  this was not the case with the m3 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21689,best reviewer on youtube  thanks mkbhd,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21690,as a ev reviewer  i think you should look into the polestar,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21691,uhm  that memory function for the tailgate is nothing unique  i have that exact function on my audi a7 from 2012 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21692,when the tech reviewer wants less tech in the car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21693,wow this is ridiculous  they tell you to put the key card in a spot without it being a holder  great point in criticising the lack of manual control as well  i do like tech but i feel they are overdoing it for the sake of showing off  if you really want to impress me then allow me vocal commands that  in tandem with the eye face tracking  would allow me to say  ac on my face chest  or  away from my body ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21694,i do not have any money but i would love to have a tesla   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21695,tesla workers furiously taking notes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21696,2 things  i feel like the matte accents look like a cheap plastic 2  i also feel like they could have incorporated the model x s door mechanism into the y s trunk  for tight spaces,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21697,i think taking literally the least reliable and most expensive part of the model x and putting it in the model y would be unhelpful ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21698,joseph white i was actually not aware it was unreliable  my fault  however  as for its price  it seems as though there is room in a  midprice  75 k crossover suv for this part  especially if its on a single door  rather than 2,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21699, jerrym8532 it is  45k  yeah  the falcon wing doors are cool  but they have single handedly tanked tesla s reliability ratings  if they just added the sonic sensor so it does not hit things using the current hatch i think that would be a great compromise ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21700,joseph white the one he is reviewing is 70k  8 25  at which price  tesla should offer additional packages including such quality of life improvements  namely those in the other models,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21701, jerrym8532 sure  when you load it up it is more  but the mechanical structure of the rear tailgate is not something they could have different versions of within the same car without a lot more dissimilarity than they generally accept ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21702,joseph white i think just generally teslas remain way too expensive  in canada  where i m from  70k would roughly equate to 90k  it s time tesla refreshes and or differentiates its models ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21703, jerrym8532 some would argue that being the only viable electric cars on the market is a pretty significant differentiation ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21704,this car was designed for autopilot  its completion will make you fully appreciate the center computer buttons ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21705,the quality is actually so bad that its not funny anymore  they should invest more in  quality control,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21706,i think tesla is the bridge to the electric movement  actually os the best brand but in the time tesla can lose this good marketing because they cars have a realy bad manufacturing problem      ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21720,hi mhbhd  big fan of your channel  just wanted to make a quick observation about the tesla card key comment  you do not need to leave the key on the location near the arm rest  just tap it once to start the car and put the card away  no sliding while driving  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21721,which device was that   mobile ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21722,lol marques said roads are pretty rough  you should visit india xd,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21723,you do not have to leave the card there you just have to tap that area within 2 mins   i think  or so of opening the door,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21726,the edges around the switch sockets  3 11  do not seem to be finished well either,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21727,not a looker by any stretch  none of the teslas look great to be honest ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21728,whenever he say  two weeks  he smiles ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21729,but does it have as much tech as a buick   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21730,at first the front looks like it is a pretty plane 4 door  but really it is a nice  unique 4 door  i feel every elictric car should be dual motors or atleast front wheel drive because of slipping roads ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21731,this is was i hate about the model 3 and y they re  budget cars but as high end prices  i know this is a topped of model but even the lower priced  one  besides the electric and smartness of it  it doesn t justify the price in my opinion  they re trying to make it sleek by adding everything to the display but in turn makes a lot of simple tasks cars a fraction of the price can do better and easier ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21732,model x comes with factory tinted rear windows ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21733,listening to marques pick part details he doesn t like about a car brand that he s bought into wholeheartedly really shows his character as a reviewer  it doesn t matter how much he likes a brand or a product  he s going to find flaws and tell us about them because that s important information for potential buyers  his integrity is amazing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21737,now removing all kind of buttons from a phone device  i can understand that  it is a very limited surface area  you want to maximise the area that can be remapped to many different use cases   it staggers me however how anyone can still think in 2020 that it is a great idea to get rid of all the tactile feedback and muscle memory that come with hardware buttons in a car  i mean  this topic has been covered by now by dozens of industrial and ux design books  explaining exactly the same mistake over and over again  and yet the  brilliant  engineers at tesla still decide to go for the myth of the genius all in one touch device  to make things even worse  it seems that some of the critical operations even require a mode switch  windshield wipers  which is especially bad in a device like a car  which is supposed to be designed in a way that you keep most of your attention  and memory load  on the road  this choice alone makes me very sceptical of the quality of teslas development team ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21739,you good at car reviews too,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21740,why tesla model y is their most important car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21741,i loved the review but what catch my attention was the image quality  i must say  this is really the greatest image quality i see on youtube lately  thanks for the content ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21742, why the model y is their most important model  because its the newest one that is why,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21743,not really  it is because it is a crossover that is actually affordable to a greater number of people than the model x  crossovers outsell sedans in the us by a lot so the model 3 is not nearly as important ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21744,70k  naaaaah,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21745,the intro auto focus got me to like,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21746,electric cars are shit  energy used to charge electric car is not necessarily green  hydrogen cars are miles better  hydrogen gas do not polluting  the air  refill takes 5 min  and range is 400 plus miles like i  normal cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21747,audio seems a little bit off  sounds like the  s s are super spity ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21748,its because he is not in his normal studio  no sound dampening and maybe a different mic to fit in the car with him ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21749,cars are less good for recording than recording studios  they are generally better at moving around swiftly though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21757,it s his business when it comes to his studio  which is not the case here  it s not about how many people care about it  it s the industry standard to get it right  especially for the money it s asking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21762,i am glad i am not the only one  i have zoned out for whole sections of his videos just agonizing over how his acoustic panels can be so askew ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21763,then he complains about a phone that has a  sharp  edge ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21764, matthewmilton you should not quit anything   unless you have a reasonable reason for it if you can get new freinds that would be great  i do not tolerate discouraging people except for constructive criticism ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21765,dragoljub radovanovi  also lots of pain issues seatbelt issues back seats not hooked down,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21768, matthewmilton well just glancing at your channel it is not particularly something that you can make money off of  but if you love making youtube videos for the fun of it  no need to stop  it too me a while to get my channel to where it is today ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21775,what is next  a tesla model how  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21776,this car does not appear to be safe  it requires you to take your eyes off the road too much  i should not have to engage with a computer screen just to turn on the wipers,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21777,the audio is so awful for a guy who spends hundreds of thousands equipment,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21778,dude panels gaps and everything is what you payed for   the quality is what you payed for so its a huge issue you cannot just brush it off like i do not pay attention to  if panel gaps do hinder drag efficiency and collect dust debris if not letting things slip inside  imagine any other with this issue people wouldn t even consider buying that shit,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21779,for a second i was expecting thissss issss ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21780,thisss isss the tesla model y  wrong channel sorry ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21781,a couple of things   1  press the right button on the steering wheel and tell the car what you want it to do   teslas like being talked to     2   nobody  uses the key card for daily use   phone or fob rule the day here   the card is what you give to parking attendants and tire store personnel  cheers ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21782,tesla needs to get some from mercedes benz to look at their build quality  it seems to be shit  despite being a wonderful electric vehicle ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21783,conclusion  just do not bother getting a model y  what  just do not ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21784,a pointer nose for better aerodynamics would have been cool,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21785,just realized this guy looks like pope from outer banks,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21786,can you put the key card in your wallet and turn on the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21787,a suggestion  unlike other vehicles  when reviewing teslas it is now possible to divide all the features and talking points into two categories  things that can be fixed by software only  and things that cannot  almost everything that can be fixed by software update has been fixed in the past  so those items do not raise much concern  but if something is rattling  misplaced  or bent out of shape  only a service may fix it and that will cost time  and money if not covered ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21797,the model y it s an amazing little suv but i think for 70k i much rather have a fully loaded audi sq5 prestige with comparable tech and safety features a higher luxury feel  bigger size and overall better built quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21798,the quality control issues is the  1 reason i have not purchased a tesla y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21800,wtf this car is trash,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
21801,if you are a youth then certain things will appeal to you   if you are mid 40 s plus and have a bad back then the seat height and getting into and out of the car trumps all   i love the in out of my i3s and will definitely be looking for something similar when it goes back   the model 3 makes my back ache just looking at it   the y looks much better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21802,it sure is ugly though  least the model 3 is decent looking  also  i wish they would get a better rim designer  teslas have the worst designed rims i have ever seen  it is like some plastic looking 1993 honda rim caps ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21803,am i the only one who finds the audio low quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21804,he has a serious mic setup in his studio and in the car he is just using a lav mic  cannot get studio quality in a car unless you voiceover the whole thing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21805,i love tesla but i hate how they put everything on the touch screen  touch screens are useless at winter  they do not always work at all and they cannot be used while wearing gloves ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21817,wanted to see more of car interiors,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21818,the lack of buttons is absurd and idiotic  it is one of those places where buttons are actually pretty important,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21819,well the key does not have to be placed in any place for the car to work  if you are not using your phone as a key  then the only time it will ask for the key is to enter the vehicle then the key can go back to your pocket  at some time it may ask for the key before it starts driving and that is the only time you need to tap it by the hand rest but after that it can go back to your pocket  i do agree that tesla needs more quality inspection  gaps are not acceptable specially for the price of the vehicles  i love my red on white dual motor long range model 3  my version is faster than the model y dual motor so i chose to upgrade to fsd and keep my car rather than trade mine over for a y  i like the extra power that current owners have and might change my mind in a year or two  nice review love your videos   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21824,fit and finish are very important  in fact  in the 70s  the lack of good fit and finish in american cars are how so many foreign cars  particularly the japanese  got a foothold in this country  so he makes a very good point about those things  important  important  important ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21837,man fit and finish on these cars are toyota corolla level from 2010 yet you are paying  40k for them  tesla really needs to improve big time in the quality department otherwise the powertrain is no longer going to be good enough to overlook the fit and finish ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21838,probably a great car if you are lucky and get a properly built one  but i am sticking to a manufacturer who can actually make cars  tesla s customer support here in norway is  varying at best which does not help ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21852,wow  those details matter a lot  i have a model 3 and only had the sun visor problem  but i actually fixed it by pushing it in    but come on  those gaps   in a 70k car   no way  need to fix that    we have a  mercedes glc 300 and thinking about getting the model y once our lease is over  i don t know if i want it now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21866,too expensive i am going to  the suv crossover market is big because a lot of companies are putting these out for  cheap  and a lot of people are lapping it up  i drive a sedan right now but my next car would have to be bigger with me now having 2 kids and wanting a dog and more room for going on vacation  just because it is the same type of car does not mean it will sell a lot  sure if you really want a tesla  now you can get a suv tesla that does not have the wing doors  because otherwise  just get the model x  it is bigger  the 30k model 3 is very hard to get  it is fine if tesla wants to sell  premium  cars but then do not pretend to be  the  ev for everyone  it is just not true  not even discussing quality  i would rather have the mg zs ev  i can even buy a second one with the change over the model y  also between the model 3 performance and the polestar 2   i know what i would rather have  you do you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21867,couldn t the wipers be voice activated  also you could set the vents  temperature  seats  etc to your profile  so the car knows if it s you or other drivers  i rarely adjust the angle of the vents  just air flow  temp  which also could be voice controlled ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

21914,marques  i love your videos  do not get me wrong  your quality is top notch in almost every department but can you please use a lav mic when it seems absolutely required  i know you are a big shotgun mic guy and that  but the car interior driving shots felt so amateur in the audio department  a lav mic would have stepped it up many many increments  as i said  absolutely love the exterior shots with the close up wheel shot turning and overall great quality  but some criticism has to be given sometimes ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
21915, 7 12 regarding the key  you are not supposed to just leave it on the center console  in fact  if you are using the key and unlock the car from the outside  you do not even need to tap the key on the center console  you just get in and shift into drive  you only need to tap it on the center console if you are been sitting around in the car because it has a timeout period  think of it like a hotel room where you tap your key on the door to enter  but you do not leave the key there  personally i exclusively use the phone app as a proximity key  but i keep the card in my wallet  if for any reason my phone was not working  i just tap my wallet and do not need to take the key out  so it does have a dedicated place  your wallet  because you never need to take it out  unless you have an rfid blocking wallet or something ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22020,i was in my buddies fancy car recently that had more stuff stuffed into the screen vs buttons  i personally feel  especially when driving and needing less distractions  buttons win every day  blows my mind they put even more into the touch screen though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22021,a place for the key   you re getting old my friend  i understand you prefer the model x or s  they are premium cars vs model 3  but the screen   voice commands and no need for key is great ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22022,marques  you do not have to keep the key card there  you place it down  step on the break and then put the key card in your pocket  you can now drive now without worrying about losing the card while driving ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22023,the irrational lack of buttons is exactly what i did not like about the model 3 i had  i loved the way the car drove  but everything on the big touch screen drove me nuts every single day  so i got rid of the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22031,the lack of physical buttons is a huge downside for me  i can adjust so many things by feel with buttons  a screen requires you to take your eyes off the road and is generally less convenient  higher tech does not always mean more functional ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22054, sa34w not a tesla ev hater but that is a huge argument for high priced ice cars   electric motors are brilliant for daily driving  quiet  quick  practical  much less complicated  etc  but when it comes to having fun  or rather a car having character  evs are a huge let down  sure  the acceleration is second to none  but that is about it  if you are looking for a fun car  you want imperfect  the engine should be loud  you should feel it work  it should make awesome noise  have turbo lag and so on because those things give something character and make it fun  i have driven a lot of evs  i would get one as a daily in a heartbeat  but they feel like an appliance  they are like a dishwasher  awesome piece of tech  makes your life much easier and comfortable but you are not having fun with your dishwasher  are you   perfect example for this is the lancia delta integrale  it is a shit car  unreliable  uncomfortable  badly made but it has so much character  it is just huge fun to drive   i am definitely getting an ev in a couple of years  but i would never ever get one as my only car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22055, maximilianw4354 lmao no thanks  i like not going deaf before age sixty  i appreciate the quiet  also ice cars are machines too  stop romanticizing it  it is impractical and needs to be replaced as soon as possible ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22067,you record everything in 8k  could you please post footage from now on in 8k  i understand not many people have 8k  but the bitrate would be higher too which is appreciated on 4k screens  downscaled  it would not cost you more either ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22082,i drove one in the non performance variant and the ride was still unforgiving  additionally  the dealer y that i drove was creaky inside and loud on the road  these fit and finish flaws in the model y turned me away from buying one  despite really wanting to like buy the car  i can t in good conscience afford to spend  60 000 on one of these with the aforementioned flaws ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22083,what is wrong with your mic ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22092,lol   auto  is also a german word that means car  that confused me a little bit  like  car focus  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22093,why is tesla obsessed with front ends that are pointy and nose diving  front end designs of tesla cars  especially model 3 and y are inferior to german cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22094,i just don t like it at all  the lack of quality stuff near the end confirmed i m just not going to consider tesla cars for a while ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22104,5 03 cannot help but see some kind of giant fish with lipstick on a giant mouth ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22105,great review  thought i might add that a lot of things such as the glovebox can be controlled using the voice control  clicking the right scroll on the steering wheel  and saying the command i e open glovebox  set ac temp to x degrees  set fan speed to x  also the keycard doesn t need to be on that surface for the whole drive  just to switch the car on and then you can place it back in your wallet  however your phone is your key so no real need  can t wait till we get the model y in aus,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22106,the suspension seems to be super stiff  those 21 inch alloys do not help either  fyi i think fit and finish is as important in a smartphone as it is in a car  panel gaps can cause serious wind noise and rust problems ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22107,i don t know i like the way it saves gas and give you high mileage   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22108,i wanted to buy the model 3  but this video has me really wanting a model y instead  perhaps in a decade when evs are considerably more affordable than they are now  although some evs out there are definitely more affordable ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22109,i think they can do much better job in order to face lift the design it looks like a duck for god sake  and while you re at it  puts on the speedometer right in front instead of monitor thank you ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22119,that gap  5 41  one reason why i would not buy a tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22120,when you crash and the car is upside down you just say   hey tesla open the door i want to get out   they are overthinking on some of the essentials  for god sake put some manual buttons on the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22198,i love that they made a car that is a bit more  affordable  you know anything under 100k or even 70k for that matter  but as much as i want to go out and get a bank to help me finance this car i am not sure with what is going on in the world today as far as the economy goes it would be a smart thing to do to go out and put yourself in more debt  maybe 2022 i will revisit hopefully by then we will know if our country will still be  our s  or china s   being that we are in debt with china ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22199,still waiting for that mkbhd and doug demuro collaboration,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22200,sorry it s just a model 3 but  fatter  uglier  and with a worse range  it looks like walter whites crossover ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22201,i want to know how good any tesla is in the snow ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22202,suppose someone hack your tesla    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22203,where is the spare wheel ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22204,bro  i love you but you sound like an old man with wanting physical buttons in the car  with that logic we should bring back blackberry keyboard ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22205,physical buttons can t break nearly as easy  no matter how good tesla touchscreens are they will break 50  faster at least than physical buttons ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22206,aaaaaaaaaaaaand that is why i still will not buy tesla  even if they have the best ev on the market  the build quality is just horrendous  how are they still making these mistakes after all these years ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22207,tesla s quality control is garbage let us be honest,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22208,you should take a look at polestar 2,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22209,i d rather get a model 3 for half the price  not that i could afford either,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22210,wish it had a heads up display for the speedo and i wish tesla would get heads out of there ass and let people repair their cars that they bought be it old  new or rebuilt ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22211,literally looks like a humpback model 3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22212,there was almost no b roll  what  and the audio sounded pretty tinny and awful   surely you could have dubbed nice audio from the studio  cmon marques  crispy video as always though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22213,6 53 no one can make that up he literally do inspect  micro things and features he should be on spacex consulting team ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22214,quality control is now very needed  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22215,about the keycard though  you just place it once  it does not say you have to keep it there  basically wrong critic,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22216,the polestar 2   i guess you should check it out ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22217, 70 grand and the adhesive for the spoiler coming loose  made in america quality right there ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22218,be careful saying  quirk feature  so doug doesn t try to sue    ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22219,marques needs to do a collab with larry chen foto ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22220,that s by my job        ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22221,that seat is baymax,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22222,what is with the clickbait title ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22223,you don t need to leave the key where you have to tap it to start  just tap it and you can take it off,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22224,its not the size of the wheels but the size of the sidewall  more side wall means less road vibration transmit through to the driver  also the low profile tires are more susceptible to blow outs on potholes and from what i have read its expensive to replace those wheels ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22225,you need to cover nio  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22226,me at beginning  so he did not use it for 2 weeks   6 00 ahh there you go ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22227,i loved the original lotus based roadster back in the day  thought the original model s was a wicked sleek vehicle  marveled at the unique falcon wing doors on the x  and appreciated the relative attainability of the 3  but this  this is a tesla that is actually swaying me right now  i do not think it is their most  beautiful  vehicle and it is certainly not their most expensive  but this just nails the package so well  so far  that i am really  really finding it hard not to like this thing  nice ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22228,time to rename auto focus to tesla talk or something since you only reference teslas for any driving experience,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22229,what is wtong with his mic  sound feels off,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22230,premium price  chinese knock off quality  no thanks ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22231,7 34 in my dad s old renault m gane  they had a  card  key system and had a little slot next to the start stop button where you would put it when driving  it is more convenient to have that little section to put your key  instead of placing it randomly in your glovebox or centre console   maybe tesla could do something like that,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22232,always good to hear what mkbhd says about a particular tech gadget before you buy it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22233,don t know how you all are into electric guitars   it s an expensive golf cart  when you have to do math to map your day because of charging then you ve officially lost your marbles   yes 290 miles isn t bad  just as good as fuel models but we can stop for gas anywhere for 2 minutes where you d need to get home before it runs out of juice instead   only charging places by me is on the turnpike ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22234,yawn ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22235,a little hot glue should be enough grip to hold that card,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22236,even cars from china have better quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22237,hey  please review realme x3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22238,the microphone quality though  not mkbhd quality   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22239,i honestly thought this was going to be a video about the battery tech  did you mention the new batteries at all  it is honestly amazing  and a big reason this is their most important car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22240,making ads  that is not youtube  its adtube  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22241,3 00 so i can fit one entire human in the boot  good to know  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22242,this guy is total tesla fanboy   70 000 is seriously over double a nice new car and if you re someone who buys a few year old used car everytime it s like 5 10x the price ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22243,your car reviews are improving,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22244,marques you are a cool dude  but why do not you stick to phones  i mean cars  really  do you even know the difference between a carburettor and full injection system    you do not say nerds  the tesla is ev  not petrol  wow  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22245,i hate the nose of the car  it looks smooshed in ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22246,it is cos it is the last letter of  s3xy  elon s main goal of producing electric cars,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22247,wait  where did you explain why this model is so important ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22248,that quality control though  yikes   70k car and all those issues ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22249,i am curious do you think having everything done in the screen can be a safety hazard because one will have to take their eyes off the road to use it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22250,every button on the touchscreen is a horrible idea,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22251,all that money to not even be able to manually control the air coming to your face  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22252,i agree with you  marques  minimalistic isn t always convenient  some manual buttons are still necessary  as much as i want the tesla   getting the model y or 3 would irritate me if i had to refer to my screen for absolutely every function of the car  minor functions should remain manual unless there s a more fluid way of using those functions besides the main screen ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22253,mkbhd  so i have been using this car for 2 weeks now and here are my thoughts  it s basically a model 3 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22254,jonatan l zzzzzzz ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22255,that is why i going to just get the x  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22256,marques in 2024  so i ve been on board starship for 4 months now and here s my thoughts ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22258,drop in audio quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22259,1 40  i see what you did there lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22260,that must be the most ugly crossover everr ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22261,the key does not have to stay there while you drive  just to start the car and enable it to drive  then put it back in your wallet,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22262,6 12 nice  if you know what i mean ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22263,congrats  marques brownlee your free roadster has been declined  because you did not talk about tesla in a up spirit ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22265,75k and still bad finish overall but hey we love tesla   s,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22266,i would like to see you reviewing other electric cars  e g  polestar 2  audi e tron  especially for you being a tesla fanboy ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22267,i think that you should take out a while to tell us about all the things that you used for a while,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22268,as a huge tesla fan  i am kind of shocked with those gaps and the spoiler alignment  it is not elon like to have the same problem over and over again for every car they make ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22269,now some idiot will be here who will first comment something and then   edit i have never received so many likes,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
22270,i hate not having physical buttons,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22271,i bet that whenever the corona vaccine comes out he would have used it for a month and in the review he would tell us that he wanted a matte black version of the vaccine,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22272, matte,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22273,i think that s a perfectly reasonable request ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22274,and marques would be the person who had already used the vaccin about a week a go,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22275, mosouss  so i have been immune to covid19 for about two weeks now ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22288,for 3 000 i would buy it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22289,you do not have to leave the card there  you just have to hold it there  then put it away once it is in drive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22290,but what about its quirks and features ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22291,but why  y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22294,so in the end it is just a review  you are not answering your own title ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22295,thanks fam i m too lazy to watch a 13 minute video lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22296,was not a question  lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22297,here is the answer to the title question   because everyone is buying small crossovers and they are going to sell tons of these ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22298,you really did just copy all of the top comments on this video,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22299,2 59  so i have been kidnapped for a couple of weeks now and here is my thoughts ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22300,damn  those are some pretty bad build quality issues  car has removable parts that should not be  lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22301,guys we have successfully made it awkward for marques to say  i have been using it for    5 54,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22302,it is good but can you leave something for doug to give it scores ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22303,the production quality of this car is garbage  wondering if that is only what you see from the outside what issues does it has on the inside  tesla has to sort out the quality issues ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22304, texting and driving is such a huge problem   what if we put a giant tablet in the car that you have to use to do everything in the car       ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22305,autopilot though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22306,tapping a huge screen in your line of sight once or twice is a lot different than staring down at a relatively small screen trying to type out words ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22307,sounds a bit apple like  creating a problem  then sell you the solution  but besides that  i like tesla  even though i would not buy one until the quality issues are gone  that would bother me  i know myself  and  of course  it is a shitload of money for model y performance ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22308,dude  the car has voice control  so there goes your theory out the window ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22309,to be fair  at the high end of the market this seems to be a ev thing  porsche s taycan does something rather similar  not the biggest fan of it to be honest  i do not know whom assumed that a knob  button or dial in an ev is punishable by death  but i kind of want to find that person and do  things  sometimes  the simple solution is the easier one   and for the love of god  no touch panels  i hate them all ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22310, duvjones  kind of want,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22311,thata why there is autopilot,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22312, jane bs9xp except even by tesla s own admission autopilot should not be used without your full attention on the road so it is not currently a good excuse,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22313, duvjones how many buttons are on your iphone or galaxy   oh sorry  you must use a blackberry,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22314, dcvide0s  not everything needs to operate like a smartphone ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22315,where is the snake man ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22316,not to take away anything from the greatness of teslas  but they really are california camrys  it seems every iphone owner buying a new car finds some tesla on which they can afford the monthly payment  it is almost a deterrent from buying a tesla for me  really looking forward to a future in which mazda or volvo  i e  companies with great design quality  offer mass market electric cars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22317,the warehouse is going to be up in flames today fml,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22318,the compact suv is a bubble bound to bust after all this  i swear this is tesla cctv now,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22319,why did not you start the video with  thhhissss is a model y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22320,the front looks like a fish mouth   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22321,i am super picky about gaps and quality control  so this car is a no no  i think at that price point quality control should never be an issue  specially to that extent ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22322,1 37 do not you mean  starlink gazing   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22323,qc is kind of a big deal on a car though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22324,oh  great  i love it  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22325,the lack of buttons and manual controls is such a turn off  i cannot imagine not having manual controls over wiper speed ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22326,90  of what tesla say they are going to build is never going to be put into production ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22327,looks like a car from the simpsons ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22328,that front dent 1 27 looks like glossy lips  s3xy  would be fun to have the car in white and keep the front red ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22329,wow,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22330,and one day there will be no steering wheel and you will need to drive with the touch screen  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22334,stop shilling for tesla  musk is a pos,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22335,it s just so ugly though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22336,i am just waiting on when us peasants can afford a tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22337,most people you see driving teslas probably cannot afford them  either  but they can afford the monthly payment  and it must be worth the cost of looking so cool ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22338, s flanders trust me  i would love to have a tesla  just from an environmental standpoint  i was just hoping when they introduced the model 3 that they were moving toward more affordable options ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22339,it s weird,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22340,all the controls on the screen seem distracting  considering your going to be driving you do not have time to look at the screen  how is that any different than looking at your phone and driving ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22341,i wish it had a grill or a light panel in the front just for a design  it looks very plain  as if something is missing,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22342,me     what made you feel good   mkbhd    the awesome matte finish   viewers   why am i still alive   lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22343,that cameraman is in creative mode,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22344,the audio is bad talking in this car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22345,nah  i will take buick,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22346,i feel like the treatment of teslas as tech gadgets has normalized buying  50k  cars for people who really cannot afford spending that much money on a car  it is bad enough that people living paycheck to paycheck buy  1000 smartphones  but it is much worse that people think that such an expensive car is justified when its cost represents a significant portion of their yearly earnings  do not be dumb and shackle yourself into suffocating loan payments for years just because you think elon musk is cool and being part of  the tesla club  will make you cooler  that is dumb ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22347,2 35 i had no idea that was a thing  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22348,most cars with auto tailgates can be set up to open to a specific height  but you can usually only set it up in the infotainment system ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22349,i wish i had a tesla,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22350,and still has no spare wheel though ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22354,god damn  i want to go back to school but i also want to buy a model y  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22355,compact suvs should not feel sporty when driving and if you think that it should you need to get your head checked ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22380,i have a model 3 lr rwd and love   every time i get in the car and start driving it  you forgot about voice activated to open the glove box and i am sure tesla will added more of voice commands in near future updates   i agree with you that tesla really miss on quality control especially this is the first vehicle they have built ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22381,i knew i wasn t a fan of the soft controls because i like being able to reach up without looking and adjust things by feel while driving  but i didn t know that so much was hidden behind menus that took multiple taps  it s almost like they don t even care about the user experience today and are entirely focused on the experience once full self driving is the norm ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22479,tesla probably is not going to say this but the reason they put everything on the screen is probably so they can produce less parts  although i guess now they have to motorize the glovebox and fans which they would not have to do if you could just manually control them  hm nevermind ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22480,personally i think it is unnecessary to make everything operated from the tablet  using your hands would be a lot easier  do not get me wrong it looks cool to control the vents from the pad  but i feel it would be so much easier to use your hands than using a tablet  that just feels like an unnecessary extra step  same with the glove compartment  you do not need a tablet to open that  we have already had a really easy way to do that  why did you make it harder ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22487,the finish of the vehicle is the singular most important part  and this car looks appalling  it is like some cheap piece of crap from 30 40yrs ago with those panel gaps  and a lack of attention to the finish of simple trim items  for the price they charge  you want a perfect level of finish  not some thing so bad  yet all you do is focus on everything else and not the most important part which is the build quality  it is a crappy car in that regard ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22552,i feel this will backfire soon  unfortunately  anyhow  it is not a good brand for eu where there are merely few service centers and car quality is very low  after years of research being focused on model x  i finally decided not to lease tesla model x  but chose instead e tron 55 s line sportback quattro ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22560,7 30  you literally never acctually use the key card because the app works like keyless entry with your phone but if you do you only have to tap the center console once and then you can put the card wherever you want ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22561,exactly  in the 18 months i have had my model 3  i have only used my key card to sync my phone key and once to the mechanic to do my safety check  if you really do want to use the key  tap to center console and put away  no need to keep it on the center console  a quick search on amazon reveals some key card pockets that can be attached if you really wanted to leave the key there  but you are more likely to leave the key behind when you exit the car so why would you want to do that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22562,matte black matters,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22563,people are still not getting it  the reason why there is one input for almost everything is because tesla s plan is autonomy  and because the car will be driving itself  messing with a screen will not matter as when driving manually  granted  it s ahead of its time and they should maybe iterate  but they want people to be future proofed now  they may dominate tech software  but the build quality is horrible compared to the top brands  we shall see where they re at in 10 years with more experience ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22580,honestly  the problem with american cars is always this crampedness inside  and now they tried to solve that by just making a suv like  model 3  that basically has the same problems   they should actually try to keep a similar profile to the model 3  slightly larger  more trunk room etc  and then work on that instead of making a full blown fat suv out of it that kind of looks weird ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22698, nielsvandenkieboom5034 yeah man  i love tesla because this is not a normal brand among the car industry  they do things differently than the other brands  they are focused on too many things in the car  such as engine  build quality and also the tech attached to it  i am a huge fan and actually saving money to see if i buy one of these cars someday soon    right now i want to do a test drive to check if i get used to it and have no problems regarding my driving    cheers mate ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22712,a 70k car that drives like a 150k car but feels like a 15k car  kind of a mixed bag  i would say for me  everyday comfort  which includes build quality and proper buttons  is more important for a daily driver than the performance  and in that regard  no tesla is even close to its more traditional rivals  i just wish the german automakers would finally get their game together and build proper electric cars  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22738, adamcforsythe he said he wants a dedicated place for the key so it does not slip away  he obviously knows it does not have to stay there ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22739, gabrielhassan9942 your pocket wallet can be the dedicated place  that or literally anywhere else in the car  the last place you should leave it is resting precariously on the center console ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22740,i m not understanding people saying that the card should be in a pocket or something  my durango has a fob  and i have a small pocket in the front console where i can leave said fob  that s what marques was getting at  give us a place to store the card ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22741, jma1095 store it in your wallet  you never have to take it out  if you ever have to use it   tap your wallet to the pillar  tap it to the center console   put wallet back in your pants  in the two years that i have owned my model 3  i have never had to use my card ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22745, jvsky1140 pardon me  but it is the others making excuses for there being no obvious place to put the card after it is been used  for me this is not a problem because a  i do not own a tesla and b  i would not use the card ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22746,it is funny how many people are trying to justify this kind of thing  current trends at the moment people are not even using wallets or use those minimalistic card holders  and do not forget women usually carry their cards in a purse inside a handbag  so the clear point is  for such a expensive car  a little more thought needs to go into what makes it the best experience for anyone who buys it and not just like make it super trimmed back to keep to clean,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22747, alfredo  i can get behind that stance  admittedly  on my key fob  i keep it on a keychain which goes on one of the hooks on my pants     i m not against options  though   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22748,i drive a dodge stratus ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22749, testikillz no  it is you that is trying to make something out of nothing   the other trend is that everyone carries a smartphone with them  everyone that owns a tesla uses the smartphone for access   you do not need to pull it out of your pocket or purse   just approach the car and the doors unlock and when you exit they automatically lock   cannot get any more minimalist than that   no one uses the card unless they have lost their phone  its battery is dead or for valet service ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22769,i would love to buy a tesla but only if they could merge technology with a retro functionality  probably would make it cheaper  just make everything as a usual 2000 car but then add the screen cameras autopilot on top   i would keep regular doors  regular air conditioning  regular buttons for the usual  the music could be on the screen i guess but for me just make a cheap car that was the dream at start  then do it  and as a bonus they should make a modular battery  so they can even sell a version with only one battery pack  that makes for example 30 miles that would be enough for a day or two in city living  and if you wish more buy the extra packs  could have slots for up to 300 miles for example ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22862,like you pointed out when touching the hazard lights  the finish of a tesla is really not up to point  especially at this price point  even with all the upsides of tesla being such a good electric car  most people around me are going for other brands because of this  if you have this type of money you are often used to an audi  tesla is not up to standard inside then  they have been chosing the audi e tron  yeah marques  but you went straight into tesla  if you used to drive a bmw or audi  that might be unacceptable ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22896, kshitijkumar4383 the build quality is so much better in the germans  i mean just look at that cheap steering wheel of the model y  the glcs one looks like a luxury steering wheel compared to that  just one example though  the whole dashboard  the seats  materials etc are all not on par with the german cars hence why it is just not worth that much money ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22897,nik7 bkh the biggest difference though is the maintenance cost  you are going to spend a lot more on maintenance for your luxury german brand after 5 years  not to mention premium gasoline  tesla is practically nothing in comparison ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22898, nik7bkh965 since when are they 70k  it is 45k for a base long range  and 55k for performance,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22899, jacestringham7022  are you so sure about that  considering that the germans are getting into the ev game  i think that it the problem that tesla is going to have to get comfortable with  competitors are coming  they bring a lot of history to the game  some good  some bad  and they can lean on that when tesla is still scratch building  oh  and they are more than willing to be ruthless and cutthroat  some have tesla squally in their sights  others are doing their own thing and carving out a niche but at the end of the day the ev market is looking like the vehicle market and with that comes the fact that it is getting crowded  look at the announcement of trucks and suv s in the last year  trucks are kind of insane with several names  some established  many of them new  in that ring and their seems to be a new bev suv about every 2 months  elon talks alot  but competitors are coming and he is going to have to earn that ev dollar like everyone else  i am not so sure that the company is build to do that  to earn that hard earned dollar ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22900, jacestringham7022 tesla does not have a dealer network  my last job was located across the street from a service center  and they were always busy  tesla quality is still not that great  even the poster of this video acknowledges that  audi and bmw dealers are all over the place and offer loaner vehicles to keep you on the road  once they go out of warranty  you still have fewer parts availability issues with zee germans than you do with teslas  i cannot even imagine paying out of pocket for a repair to a five year old tesla  which by then would be functionally obsolete ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22903,nik7 bkh the kona is a death trap  i intern for toyota that has a hyundai across the way  i hear so many horror stories from people who got rid of there kona s for the rav 4  the kona is prone to severe engine failure  plus hyundai is a sketchy company  one close to me shut down because of rona and they dipped with a bunch of people s money  one lady even bought out her lease and the dealer took her money and didn t give her the car  so now corporate won t refund her and is telling her she s late on her lease payment  that s why i recommend nissan  honda  mazda  subaru  and toyota  but that s just my two cents ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22904, nik7bkh965 70k is nothing  if you count no gas and no stupid oil and no stupid engine problems and other related stuff  same same but different ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
22905,the kona electrics are only starting at 20k for the ice versions though  at least in the us  once you look at an electric kona the price shoots up to a 37k base price  when compared then to the model y the difference is seen more easily as  do you want a more affordable electric car or would you rather have a more premium car  one leg up i feel tesla has here is the premium isn t just name but range and performance as well  i don t think that means the model y is the perfect hatchback for everyone but it is a harder deal to pass up if you re already looking into the ev sector and trying to make your purchase go as far as possible ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22909, skellyphotography6227 no  both are in the small suv crossover category but the tesla costs more than twice as much as the kona although having a less quality interior  but there will always be stupid fan boys who go for the brand name instead of the better product  just like apple iphone fanboys  there are a lot of similarities between tesla and apple fans  as deeper you go into the topic  and smarter you get   the higher the probability you do not get a tesla iphone because you understand the flaws ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

22990,it looks like tesla put everything on a touch screen for maximum manufacturability of a car  those  manual  vents most likely require a lot of manual labor or complex tooling and automation  so everywhere in tesla cars you can see their motto   good part is no part ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23045,one thing i noticed is the sound inside the car while you are driving  tesla should pay more attention to the thumps and thuds from the suspension as well as  if not more so  the creaking of the panels  at that price point  the model y should sound much more intact that it does currently  i realize this is more challenging with an electric car since there is inherently less noise which can make things more noticeable ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23139,shocking bad quality  really want to like tesla  the production quality for a car in that price range is ridiculous  who pays that much money for a car that literally falls apart when it leaves the factory  laughable ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23140,i am often asking myself if we should be supporting someone like musk by buying these vehicles of is buying them even really matters in the grand scheme of things,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23150,qc is an ongoing major issue with tesla s they re built like crap  a dealbreaker for me i m afraid  with much better built evs from the major brands catching up with tesla  so i ll wait for now  i m a traditional petrolhead anyway  i d only want an ev for the daily commute  shopping and such  not to just go out and enjoy a drive for the heck of it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23151,driving like a true nerd,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
23152,i dislike buttons so i am very glad that this car does not have any buttons   it also looks quite nice the only problem that i would have  is where can i charge it  i do wish that the quality would be better i am still waiting until apple comes out with their car hopefully sooner than later so that i can finally have a car that i really want to drive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23153,4 37 how was this shot made  with a drone flying over the car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23154,yes,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23155,yeah you care about driving not the quality of finishing of your car even paying so much   for it  bro what if water reaches electrical parts of the car due to poor quality control  tesla will not easily help you with that  and you know how long they take to repair a car  i would like to have a good quality product for the money i pay  period  tesla reached mkbhd to save their ass due to the recent backlash they have been facing due to poor qc  and marquis just made a company centric video  not a customer friendly one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23156,i would love to see a day in the life  video from you  i think it would be refreshing to see your daily routines hobbies outside of what you normally do ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23157,ok i like that car mkbhd  but 70k that is alot what we all need are tesla s that are more affordable  even though gas cars are less expensive does not mean that because we buy tesla s and we like them should not be more expensive  people who wants to buy them are not going to get one because some people s homes who bought them back in the day did not cost that much we need better pricing on the cars  the quality of the builds can be fixed  a little better quality controll can fix that problem peace,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23158,so sorry but the audio on this video is shocking   just letting you know,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23178,rimac  when ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23179,maybe when they start manufacturing in germany their quality will improve  currently their quality is below cheap russian cars   dacia  with that pricetag and crap quality they are not really competing in europe  you can get a very slick mercedes  bmw or audi for 70k  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23180,i really want one  but the price is just insane  i guess the standard range model will fix that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23181,there will be no standard rage model  but tesla is constantly bringing down the price of other y models,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23182,rwd tesla model y is the go for you  it is a sick car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23183,i would go for the cheapest model 3 in that case  after refunds maybe 31k in the usa,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23184,zak bruh 20k you good  i d agree at 30k though since vw is also bringing the id4 for like 35k and the quality is way better than tesla s,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23185, marcelr299 the price of the id4 is not revealed yet,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23186, zak because tesla makes there money when you buy the car  where as other manufacturers make the most money of you through maintenance costs over time  which will be much lower with a tesla,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23187,zak if you compare the quality of tesla and german car brands you will notice why german cars are more expensive also what s so bad about a 35k suv ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23188,rochdi corsaire its been confirmed that it s going to cost around 35k in germany,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23190,jeff harrison rwd is great if you live somewhere like florida  not so great when you get snow on a regular basis  at  45 000  i ve got tons of options for a better equipped awd vehicle  it ll be interesting to see what competition does to the price over the next 5 10 years ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23191,you also have to think about the maintenance  that is much less cost compared to a gas car  and speaking of gas  i m pretty sure that is more expensive than electricity ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23192,electric range sucks already might as well stick with gas,[1 0 0 0 0 0]

23206,are you dumb ,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
23207, kevindelgado7083 as dumb as you  nah  i do not think so,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
23208, kevindelgado7083 you are the dumb one  to even mention that windows are tinted is as obvious as saying that water is wet  all cars come with tinted windows these days  all ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
23209,he s referring to multiple cars  so  back windows  can referrer to the back window on multiple cars  and  rear windows  can refer to the rear passenger windows  or vice versa ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23230,yikes at all those qc issues  dude you should be more concerned by them  not just scoff them off as if it is the  norm   if you went to tesla and handed them a 70 grand check for that car and they gave you that car with all those issues i would refuse to even get on it until they fixed that shit  you need to be more critical about that kind of stuff  not just put them in a short section as if  yeah then there is this shit  but does not bother me much  like the freakin tail spoiler and front right sun visor were about to fall off  that is not the quality anyone should expect from a 70 grand vehicle ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23273,you should have mention jd power result which put tesla as the least reliable car in us  furthermore is that one of the main market of tesla which is norway stop buying tesla s cars due to reliability issues and quality issues   i am not a tesla hater  i think they pushed the electric car to the center of the market  however they have to many issues and i think the hype around them is too much  i truly believe that if tesla was a chinese company we were already thrashing  it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23274,do not let this guy sugar coat tesla s cars  because he does not give you all the real truth of owning a tesla  they are all trash  out of warranty tesla s will cost you more than the car itself and their customer s service is bs  design flaws  noise creaking  etc  search >> rich rebuild << on youtube and decide  if you are on budget and buying a tesla  marques is only very good at nitpicking and reviewing mobile devices he is good at it  no doubt ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23302,so tesla is overkilling basic feature like windshield and ac ducts with touch screen  reaction time for manual knobs is very quick and inbuilt physical memory with less distraction to brain  having all these in a touch screen is a serious distraction  how different is it from using cell phone and driving  next gen tesla cars may even use indicator knobs in touch screen ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23318,teslas are known to have cheap build quality and some really ludicrous defects   like i have seen it 3 times now when one of my  acquaintances purchased a tesla but returned it coz of some manufacturing defects   seems like elon should spend more time looking after his company than on twitter ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23319, aaronstone6183 yeah i do respect elon and everything he and his team did for society in general but there is no denying the fact that he is become a huge attention whore since 2018  weird how he bashes instagramers on the joe rogan podcast when he literally does the same with his twitter ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23320,looks luke a ford focus and tesla is just starting to do what activision did with call of duty and apple copied from them  build the same crap over and over with minor upgrades and people will buy them because of the name,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23453,still amazing that they still not getting their shit together  it has been over 10 years now with the model s and several years with the model 3  tesla is lucky because it has all these fanboys but if you buy something for 70k it definitely should have a better or at least on par quality like a cheap car  even 10k cars have better build quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23454,i have always been a  hater  for saying the quality needs work for the price  i will be interested too once they fix it  it is funny because my mazda 3 which was a quarter of the price new is still put together better ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23638,the interior i am going to is too minimalistic  it makes driving harder than it should be  sure  teslas are being designed with autonomous driving in mind  so in the future it will not matter if all the controls are through a central touch screen   but we are still quite far off from that vision of the future  i think the bare minimum should be speed indication in your line of sight  manual ac adjustment  temp  power and vents  windscreen wipers  even if they are automatic  window controls and glovebox access  which madman tought it would be  clever  to have you access a sub menu to open a stupid latch ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23639,what kills me is that they don t just do for aesthetic reasons  it s just to save money for it s cheaper model cars lol  they have no problems with buttons and some manual controls because the model s and x exist ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23640, sbml5243 i think it is more of a marketing gimmick to make the car feel like  the future  i do not see how cutting a plastic latch thingy from the glove box would make the car cheaper  the electric motor and the controller  not to mention the software to operate it  cost way more than a simple molded plastic part that is made by the thousands ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23641,wow for  70k i would expect a lot more attention to details   i have to say i really like the idea of tesla vehicles  but i m not willing to put up with poor quality at that price ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23642,hello,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23643,the card key does not need to be left on the center console to drive it   my wife drives a model 3 and the card key is only to unlock the driving ability or syncing with the phone app ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23644,quality control is really bad if they sent this car to review  what is going on  tesla needs to put a lot of focus to qa  review of polestar 2 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23648,is it just me or does anybody else just not fancy tesla s that much  like the electric car part is nice  being all eco friendly and whatnot   but it s all this fancy new tech that they put in that just seems unintuitive and unnecessary  like the windshield wipers and the air vents hidden in the touchscreen display among other things  heck  i don t even really care that much for autopilot because i like driving  unlike most people apparently  i mean what s the point of the super fast acceleration if you re just going to let a computer drive for you   of course i know there are legitimate applications out there for self driving cars  and on top of that  how is this car going to drive 5 years down the line  a lot of gasoline cars  electronics are already having enough problems  and in tesla s  when literally everything is controlled by electronics and computers  something is bound to break  marques  review unit was already falling apart when he got it  and that doesn t speak well for its longevity  i feel like there are many other electric cars out there where their design is focused less on being unnecessarily innovative  and more focused on designing something that works well and reliably and that s what i d value most in the car that i buy ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23656,you literally never mentioned why the model y was tesla s most important car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23657,it is not important in a review of the specific car  for shareholders yes  but not for the of the car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23658,came here to say this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23659,why,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23660,hahahaha let me answer  model  s  model  3  model  x  model  y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23661,i thought it was going to be the same price as or lower than the model 3 and that more people buy suvs  y  than sedans  3  which would make it the breakthrough model  the model y makes me very disappointed in tesla  or maybe tesla needed the model y as an extra step to get the company ready for the mainstream  i hope so ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23662,it is the final model that is why,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23663,martyvh maybe in this day and age suvs and trucks should just be more expensive  maybe even add a high environment tax of some sort  it makes me sick how car purchases in germany develope the same way as in the us  you don t need a car this huge  it s no really usefull for any everyday task  maybe transporting your guns in the back of your truck but that s a pretty  murican problem lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23664, uilliam56 you deserve a medal,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23665,its because its competing in the highest selling market of car types   cross overs mini suvs ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23668,maybe because of the matte black   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23669, uilliam56 roadster   s3xyr,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23670,i will answer this question  model 3 and model y are the most accessible models for customers and the survival of the company will depend on these products  model 3 and model y will ensure that tesla has the mid tier segment covered which will cover all their operating expenses and more  model s and model x are the more premium range which has lower volume and a smaller market but ensure higher profitability ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23675,because he sawppl puttina bed in the back and camping  before the car were ever designed,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23678, horsthorst11 so just because you do not want more legroom  headroom  more people in your car  more luggage space  a safer car  the higher the car the safer it is generally  and other stuff  you want it gone  a higher tax  more expensive  i absolutely love suv s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23679, horsthorst11 it is called a family with kids  may have heard of the concept  i hear there is quite a few of those out there  the only difference between this car and my ford focus sedan is that its higher  and i think it would be nice to sit higher ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23683,diavire mcgruffin how is an suv better for a family with kids  you have just as mush space of luggage in a station waggon while suvs are as aerodynamic as a truck and shit out tons of co2  but i get you  sitting in a higher and heavier car you can at least be sure that the other person is really dead if you get into an accident with a cyclist or a pedestrian ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23688, diavire you are right that is the only difference,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23699,except it was not really a question  there is an   instead of a   in the title  if you put  this is  in front of the title ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23700,it is the most important car because its the car that will make tesla profitable from my perspective  they almost perfected the manufacturing process for the model 3 and model y is built on top of the model 3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23701, 1ewi5 although i agree with that the y is definitely in the higher price year 70 grand that s a low trim s or used x,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23702,yeah bruuuz,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23703,its the most important because its a relatively affordable tesla and also a crossover suv  considering the suv trend in the world right now  its no doubt the most important car tesla has ever made ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23704, albertsebastian6836 id say model 3 is as important as y  as many will prefer model 3  do you know whether y is bigger or just higher ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23742,while the driving dynamics of a car are important  fit and finish are as well  so it really is inexcusable to be dismissing those issues on what is a  70k  vehicle  my 2017 cr v touring  first year model  was half the price of the model y you reviewed and had no where near as many fit and finish issues  and my car was built at the time that honda was cranking them out as fast as they could to meet demand  yes  honda has been building cars for far longer then tesla  but when a car company cannot get visors  back hatches  and simple trim pieces to fit right  it really makes you question what else may be wrong with the vehicle ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23755,no button ui is pretty scary to me  imagine if the car crash into something and the battery died ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23756,all those small annoyances like not having as many manual buttons are small  but most people keep their cars for 5  years so they could easily be deal breakers  as for the fit and finish  it is a  70 000 car  that is all i am going to say ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23757,do they actually listen to what marc says  and the bg music in the end   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23759,tesla makes a great car but i think they should go a bit more traditional on certain things  i have heard a lot of people complaining that tesla does not put their car together as well as they could  i do not like that all the buttons are gone i think the center screen would be a little too distracting for me,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23760,  so why is the model y their most important car  am i the only one that missed his answer ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23761,it is a small crossover and small crossovers sell  that is the answer ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23763,i am a tesla fan but i still feel the manufacturing needs to be improved  you are paying 70 grand so you should get good quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23764,the title was not accurate at all he not once spoke about the y being important and stuff this was just a normal review and now i m just left wondering why was it so special marques  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23769,never had a tesla but the panel gap thing is one of the biggest things blown out of proportion  all the cars i had had some sort of gaps  after this bs blew up i checked my current brand new car and it too had uneven panel gaps  soooooo ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23795,lause the card is actually the secondary mode of access and turning on   phone is primary and doesn t need to be touched at all   simply walk up to car  it opens and is ready to go   when finished stop  get out and walk away  it locks and turns off ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23796,you actually do not even have to do that  once you unlock the car with the key  you have like 30  maybe 60 now  to put the car in drive before it requires the key card,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23797,shane caldwell the car does not require the keycard at all  i read through the manual it doesn t say it only gives you 30 to 60 seconds to put it in drive  once your in the car with the phone it is always on,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23798,shane caldwell this is only when you setup the phone as the key is when you need to tap the keycard within 30 seconds  once the phone is setup it will not ask you for the keycard at all,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23824, anactualmole9565 everytime a comment along those lines crops up some guy like you always comes and says  just get a job  hey you realise that everyone has their own journey  their own way of doing things  that probably is the smart thing to do but you have not taken into account their personal circumstances or anything  it is not as simple as you think it is ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23829,matteblackhd,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23830, jlu get a job could mean anything between  start working in a corporation and rip people off  to  do small jobs at home to make money  begging for money online is not going to take them anywhere  there is about a thousand ways to make money or set up to make money building up your resume and such  and yes  i can appreciate the struggle of starting a channel but promoting your channel in the comments does not help anyone  it is just obnoxious  unrelated and a bore much like this arguement we have had here,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23831, anactualmole9565 i just find it odd that you need to offer up the suggestion that someone should go find a job when to any reasonable person that is already the first thing they do when seeking economic benefits  that is already a given    i also do not understand how you can call this argument unrelated and a bore when you initiated this by giving someone life advice  similarly unrelated and as you say  a bore  but i digress ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23832, printskill8173 sure sure  i think this should be a way to repent for my sins for using vpn to play on your country because russians are so good at mlbb that i cannot even win  subed ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23861,he is got money to do it aftermarket,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23868, iamjames8200 no hahahaah i said they could always wish for me to die hahaha  i am not angry hahahaah  it is just everyone misinterpret what i am saying  but it is okay haha  thank you anyways <3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23869,frenziiieee subbed dude  i understand how it feels  and youtube itself isn t easy either  these fuckers telling you to get a job and etc just either want to grab attention for a bad attitude on your side or just jealousy  continue working my guy  i know you ll get there ,[1 0 1 0 0 0]
23870, printskill8173 bruh  you make it like no one else is struggling in this dark time and no need to be flaming people because they have a different opinion than yours  edit  i am going to you should keep posting videos  instead of begging for subs in youtube comments and by the way  by flaming people you do not resolve anything ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23871, alx6985 did not you read my comment  i said  i do not have a good pc to edit it  hays  i am just going to say sorry  okay  i am sorry  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23872, 307skylake7 hey  thank you so much <3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23873, printskill8173 subscribers do not earn you money  people who watch your videos earn you money  it is viewers that get you money  you can have 10 million subs and you only get 10 views on a video  you will not earn anything ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23874, and just streaming will not help you become a streamer  that is how it worked years ago  but now there is so many big streamers and so many small streamers that people are never going to find your stream  there is 2 million active broadcasters just on twitch  and there is just as many on youtube  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23875, the best way you could grow your stream is by making good videos that people will watch  that people care about  that people are interested in and just mention what days you stream on at what time so they will come to watch you live because they are hooked to the video and they are interested in your personality  just mention your stream schedule after your intro and before the end of the video ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23876, having a lot of subs  a few videos and barely any views on them with barely any engagement will actually hurt your channel  the youtube algorithm will just sweep your channel under the rug  the algorithm prefers channels that grow their subscriber base from videos  people who subscribe to your channel while watching one of your videos ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23877, just some friendly advice  take it or do not but that is how you can make it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23928, ever since the mustang mach e started rolling out  troubled tesla has been slamming their head against the floor wondering what to do and whether or not they can survive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23930, check out the inside of the mach e   stylish  sexy  fun to drive   it is the car that everyone wants   even tesla fan boys   remember old hat blackberry and what happened there ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23931, check out the auto trader   thousands of people have listed their tesla s for sale  it is no longer cutting it since the appearance of the mustang mach e,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23932, i would advise you to test drive the mustang mach e to see for yourself  tesla is having a hard time selling their cars now  you do not keep slashing the price of your car if demand is great  you slash them because the are not selling  it appears that they may have a hard time making wall street numbers  they may need to give the cars away as nobody wants them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23933, a few more things to note ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23934,   elon musk has been pounding the table telling everyone that tesla s share prices is over valued  his brother sold off a boatload of tesla shares  and many insiders dumped millions and millions of dollars in shares  the average investor is watching all this happen in horror  tesla share price has been death spiraling out of control ever since the mustang mach e started to roll out ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23935,   cybertruck preorder numbers are fictional  a  100 deposit is not a serious deposit for someone wanting to buy an expensive vehicle  so why was this done  it was a brilliant idea  get multiple people buying multiple cybertrucks which will make it appear that millions are being sold  10 000 people each giving up a  100 refundable deposit for 100 vehicles each makes it look like a million were sold   elon then tweets these numbers  this causes excitement  raises the price of the shares at an incredible level so that additional shares can be sold into the market to raise money at the peak price  a pump then dump scheme similar to gme  there is a video on youtube where one guy exposes how he is placing deposits for over 50 cybertrucks  even though he has no intensions on buying them  it is just to help in the  pump  part  a brilliant idea  unfortunately  there is always someone left holding the bag ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23936,   many well know analysts have a target price on tesla shares much lower then where they currently stand  one target sits at  67 00  these analysts know what is really going on ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23937,   elon urges people not to buy tesla cars that are made towards the end of each quarter as the cars are simply rushed and slapped together just so they can hit wall street numbers  if they do not make those numbers  it will be like a hammer coming down on a souffl    another reason why the price on tesla cars may have been slashed   the quality has been suffering very bad lately ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
23938,   many tesla fan boys who have recently test drove the mustang mach e have reported that they now love the mach e  and thinks that it is the better car of the two ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23983,that is a good point about potholes  i have got low profile tyres and we have pretty average roads so spend a lot of time dodging holes  i wonder how the self drive feature handles those   also  elon probably gave marques one that did not pass qc because he did not think marques would do him like that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

23994,hey marques  a lot of what you thought was cool has been standard in a lot of compact suv s already  like the tinted back windows and programmed rear hatch height  does this make the tesla model y less desirable knowing this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24003,that seems like a lot of cognitive load  cars are one thing where you don t want it to be unintuitive  because when you have to think about something stupid like adjusting the air flow  you re going to have an accident  modern jeeps have this problem too  so do bmws  mind you  many modern cars suffer from this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24004,this is why you should not adjust the airflow while driving in the first place  regardless if manually or via a tablet  to be honest ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24045,the build quality is a huge concern  tesla doesn t get hounded like other car manufacturers due to its popularity  but they do need to look at the finer aspects too  and lack of buttons is definitely one trend in automotive industry that needs to die  push the envelope but not off the table ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24048,anyone feel like it s being so much futuristic  that it gets more inconvenient  and it feels even bad that since tesla is kind of the leader in this segment  this inconveniences will persist and gradually becomes the norm  like when apple removed the headphone jack  there has to be buttons and levers and things in your car which you develop muscle memory for  and can just operate it subconsciously  like the slider buttons of phones or shutter buttons of old sony ericssons   that should be tech  right  making stuff easier so that you don t have to put a second thought into it when you need it to work ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24087,white interior   it would hardly 2 hrs to ruin it  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24088,the problem with tesla is that they have assumed that highly automating assembly plants would ensure assembly quality   does not work that way  machine calibration for repeated consistency is as much an art as a science  as is the training of staff to work with complex machines so that you get the best performance from both elements to achieve world class quality  toyota has mastered the art  especially the lexus division  the question becomes will toyota  as well as gm  ford  honda etc catch up to tesla s unquestionable lead in battery and electric motor technology before tesla figures out how to build cars with assembly quality better than a 1970s ford pinto  jury is out ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24114,it is always the one obvious problem nobody talks about  home charging  with about 70  of usa citizens living in homes  which can be retrofitted with a charging station  oops  nearly 40  rent those homes  so  if you have the money to install a charging station at your home  only 42  of homes can actually make that decision on their own  much less fund it  the other 30  live in some form of apartment  condo  duplex  and individually have no control over installing costly charging stations  hmmm  the  70 000  zero carbon emission car is amazing  as long as you ignore the fact that most power grids are fueled by coal so for now  it is the highly inefficient coal powered vehicle  car with some poor workmanship that needs overnight recharging  which is very difficult if not impossible to actually setup  i think it is a huge back end improvement  but unless the power supply sources  renewable with zero carbon emission   and charging station issues continue to be improved upon  well the y series is still too expensive to make a difference  it just is not even a part of a work to deal with global warming as it is  as a fun toy for ecologically socially concerned people who make money by playing with tech toys  sure   all that said not that anyone will ever read youtube comments  much less agree   if elon s team of engineers were tasked with fixing say  the washington  d c  subway escalators and elevators  the decade long decauchle of ringing hands while collecting engineering assessment strategy planning would not have occured  instead of lining the pockets of people with connections  the matter would be dealt with on time  within budget   better  is more than a start  it is an improvement  understanding all that came before  not perfectly  but better  and building upon that to create   it s really hard to piss on elon  despite his deranged tweets and outrageously priced y series ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24115,next tesla car   y  x   2x 3,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24116,i think the most important message to take away here is that tesla contracted a man who reviews phones to review their new car  they want this car to sell like a phone  so you will buy  or lease  the new one in 2 3 years ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24168,the huge touch screen and lack of physical buttons  knobs  etc  to me is a huge problem because you would almost always have to take your eyes a off the road to do change anything  i recall a few years back honda took away the audio volume knob and you had to use the touch screen and there was a huge uproar over it  so much so that the knob returned for the next model  any driver gets use to the muscle memory of wear certain buttons and knobs are pretty quickly with anew car  but that can never happen on a tesla  dumb  and please allow  iphone users to have car play  is that too much to ask  two more quips  put a proper front  grill  on both the 3 and y as there is on the s and x  they both look like they were kicked in the teeth  sorry but after 100 years of cars with front details and grills  you kind of get use to it  secondly  unless the huge pano sunroof automatically darkens during bright days your back seat passengers  ie  kids with their ipads and switches  are not going to be happy  my daughter always asks for me to close my pano roof on my pacifica  i love a traditional sunroof but i see no point in these glass roof panels that bake your bake seat passengers ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24177,marques  loved the review  i think you ve improved greatly since first doing these car reviews  i do also very much appreciate that you acknowledge you cover a different area than car reviewers  in that you don t cover the driving dynamics   performance aspects as much  i think it actually lends more credibility to your channel  as opposed to the dozens of other tech reviewers pretending as though they re car experts ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24178,my impression is tesla did not do partnerships  if they gave marques a review unit they must be looking to increase sales ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24179,bruh that one vid in which rear bumper comes of only due to heavy rain  lol  such a bad quality of tesla  they have tech but not proper hardware,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24186,the mic has issues,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24187,harsh audio  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24188,the tailgate memory is a pretty common feature  at least in luxury cars  now  definitely not exclusive to tesla  although that seems easier to set than mine is ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24189,do you really think that the poor quality stops at the places you can see  what if the battery is poorly assembled ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24190,model 3 < model y,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24191,tesla s design is poor  improvised and lacks any aesthetic value ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24193,2 48 super cool shot,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24194,had my y since mid march and it does not look like the quality issues have really improved much   fun car  but man does it have a lot creaks  rattles and misaligned panels   even had to have a mobile tech come out and re align the hatch as it was starting to get caught when opening   would only go up a few inches before stopping and closing    the frunk was the same where off the lot it was so misaligned that it had a 0mm gap on one side and up to 15mm on the other side   could not even pass a sheet of paper in the gap which would probably lead to paint being rubbed off   mobile tech was able to fix that one after a good 30 minutes    will not even get into the car going into reduced power mode on a 500 mile trip which did not allow it to go above 60 mph   not fun having semis run down your back since you cannot go the speed limit   tesla s advice was to drive and drop it at a service center at my destination   in the end  the car was not assembled properly and two of the temp sensors where not hooked up in the right order  causing the car to think it was over heating  good to see that they are selling a ton of these  but they have a long ways to go with quality and even the sales experience ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24202,thisssss is a model y ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24221, davidev94 using the key card is not the keyless start   it is the backup key  keyless start feature uses your smartphone with the tesla app  and yes  you just keep the phone in your pocket and step on the brake pedal to  start  the car  you can also buy the keyfob if you do not have or want to use your smartphone ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24222,and then what  put it back in your pocket after you sat down ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24223, laus0 yes  or leave it in the cup holder  not a good idea because you might forget it  not any more inconvenient than other emergency backup key solutions with other keyless start systems  in fact  it is just an nfc card so you do not even need to take it out of your wallet  just tap your wallet ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24236,tesla is doing great work on the drivetrain and battery tech  yet there is so much that makes the brand seem like a passing trend  people have bought in to the cool factor of owning a tesla but are forgiving of what seems pretty obvious reasons to not buy a tesla  build quality  even as marques points out the defects all over his new car  he seems to be apologizing for them  says he doesn t actually care about build quality  wow marques  generous  design  you can t adjust the vents or open the glove box without multiple non tactile pokings and glancing at the touchscreen  that s terrible  the look  to me the model x is today s pontiac aztec except for everyone loves tesla  so the hideous proportions and look of the body design is forgiven in exchange for the prestige  if that prestige slips  will its customers and fans keep overlooking its flaws  it won t be for the value ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24238,why am i complaining on the microphone and his when it s a mkbhd video ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24239,i know teslas do not really need aerodynamics for mileage but i just do not get how or why the fronts are so boxy and flat  obviously the wind will smack it like a wall and it probably does affect like 1mpg at least  plus it looks shitty  like why not implement a bit of aerodynamics and have it cool the batteries or something  like a pass thru that hits the batteries and they will not be as hot  perhaps the very bottom does this but why not do so with the entire grille area  or at least point it further down and make it sharper  i do not know i just do not get the styling sometimes  for some models it works because they do make it look more sporty but for the 3 and y i do not know  design is not that great in the front ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24301,electric cars are ok yes but in my opinion is no fun to drive not even automatic transmission is fun to drive but its more fun than an ev now manual transmission is fun to drive give me a manual vehicle any day any time its just too bad they are phasing it out because of the many non drivers about the place i must drive the car not the car driving me the auto pilot is a cool feature yes however i would not have any need or use for that as i said i must be the driver not the car driving me real drivers drive cars not the other way around that is for non drivers ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24364,why do i get supersaf vibes from the thumbnail,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24365,the front is horrible  it looks like plastic ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24366,does it have voice commands  doing everything on the screen is risky  it takes just 3sec to crash,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24368,how much stock does he have in  tsla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24369,the cleanliness and precision in mkbhd s and mrwhosetheboss s video is unmatchable ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24370,4 21 how did you shot that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24371,i saw the model y a few months ago on the freeway when i went to the airport  it was on the back of those trucks with 4 cars in the back  it was also like 4 in the morning so they probably transport in the night so that no one can see them ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24372,it is tesla s most important car  so  they decided to do a crappy job and build a car with sub par standards ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24373,model y is a model 3 with quarantine body,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24377,stop your nonsense    tesla is a horrible carmaker  they got the worst quality control  stop sucking elon off boy,[1 0 0 0 1 0]
24378,one thing about the car key   pretty sure you can just tap it at the designated place  and then put it away  it doesn t need to stay at the spot behind the cupholders after you ve unlocked it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24379,i love when youtubers recognize each other  marques recognizes doug so often and even when it is low key  i love it  you two need to make a collab,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24380,tesla s interiors is empty and boring  just a steering wheel and a huge ass screen  and thaats it ,[1 0 0 0 0 0]
24381,elon   we are going to land on mars ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24387,not going to lie  i would be embarrassed to drive that car at that high price point with such low build quality  i get  the tech is high end  but man  the car has got feel like all it s screws have been tightened if i m going to pay that price point ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24388,five years from now i will have a tesla   let s see how this comment ages ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24389,opens trunk and sets the height in the same way my 2017 cr v does   that is crazy   and the tesla is ugly    a model 3 with big wheels and a bulge in the roof   wow ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24395,waiting on the model e to complete the word model s model 3 model x model y got to love elon,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24396,for  70k  those small qc issues should absolutely not exist whatsoever  it is the small annoyances that ruin what would otherwise be a excellent experience  tesla still has a way to go in terms of refinement ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24397,thinking of arrival of tesla in india   bdw its 8 am in india,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24398, mkbhd man those intro is dope  you just kill it every time ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24399,i agree with the windshield part you don t need touchscreen for that imagine driving on highway and it suddenly starts raining  do you focus on the road or screen to turn on the vipers  it s kind of risky,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24577,8 38 respect to marques for pointing out the qa issue even though it is a review unit from tesla   too many tesla fanboys girls will excuse these and celebrate quarterly delivery numbers  long term success is predicated on getting build quality right  tesla has been pushing back on a lot of these issues as  within spec   if you refuse delivery  i ve also heard they will prevent you from ordering the same model for a certain period  some will say i m a tesla short troll  i m a happy tesla owner and investor  but my support is not blind  quarterly delivery numbers  growth  and s p 500 inclusion are not everything  it doesn t matter if these people who voice issues are the minority   and please don t use the straw man of saying all oems have issues  tesla can and probably will fix these issues in the factory in due time and the pressure helps  there s too many millennial hypesters who bow to papa elon and too worried about their cost basis to put their money where their hype is  or dare mention those types of build quality issues   so kudos again to marques  respect from another nj brother  for anyone watching  best thing to do is to wait until they sort this sh t out or just be prepared to accept small flaws in the near term ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24933,so  as for the card key  it really is just a valet or backup thing  but  if when you do use it  you do not need to leave it there  it is just an nfc card  tap it so the notice goes away and you are good to go  there is nothing there to hold the card because you never really use it and you are not supposed to leave it there ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24934,i don t know if the are in the us but you should take look at the polestar 2  i think it could be a nice competitor for the model y 3 ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24936,wow  the extreme lack of buttons just kills things for me  i adjust so many things through just feeling for the control without looking  volume and climate control i could adjust to  but i have to look at a screen to turn on my windshield wiper  what kind of a cruel joke is that ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24937,it is sometimes a bit annoying  but the auto wipers work pretty well now  there  are  two windshield wiper related functions that you can do from the stalk  though  you can trigger a single wipe from the stalk  and you can also clean the windshield from the stalk ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

24956,build quality seems sub par plus lacking a lot of creature comforts for a 70k car,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24957,as someone who has owned a model 3 for over 2 years now  a lot of the things you mention about buttons are complete and total non issues  windshield wiper controls were an issue when the car was newer because the auto wipers sucked  but they are so good now that i do not even think about it  air vents  i set the air output when i first got the car and have literally never had a need or desire to change it again  the only thing i do wrt climate is adjust the temp up or down depending on how i am feeling  and that is it  again  the auto climate is so good that i never put it in manual or anything like that  there is no function of the car that would be improved at this point by having a manual control  also  regarding the key  you are not meant to keep it there  you tap it and put the key card away  you do not leave it in the tap zone ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
24958,the model y might do well in the north american markets  but in europe and other regions  people are spoiled with much better options around the same price range   better interior  better exterior and better build quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25004,mk  you are looking at this without the advantages of wisdom and maturity  which only comes with age and experience  yes  it is laudable to hope for  clean  energy and  eco friendly  vehicles  unfortunately  despite all the propaganda  which almost identical to what was being discussed in the 1970 s  ev s most definitely  are  less environmentally friendly than internal combustion engine vehicles  even less than hybrid vehicles  aside from the amount of parts that will end up in a hazardous waste site  do the research  the drain on the power grid causes more environmentally unfriendly emissions than an equivalent number of modern combustion engine vehicles  it is not even close  where do you think the electricity comes from  coal power plants  there is not even remotely enough hydroelectric power plants in the usa  and even fewer nuclear power plants  if you replace all the vehicles on the road today with ev s  you will see an increase in smog that the usa has never experienced before  cities and towns that never experienced it will see a sharp increase in respiratory ailments and related deaths  the usa will shamefully surpass china and india as the top producers of smog and air pollutants  do not take my word for it  do the research  this argument is not new  the only difference now  is that telsa has been allowed to exist as a company that does not make a profit  because it has been propped up by government grants  a k a  tax dollars  it never should have   allowed to go to market  without private investors  and without demonstrating how it can be truly more environmentally friendly ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25162,marques  could you one day make a video about the quality of tesla s used cars and the process of getting one  i know for some people getting a new tesla is way out of their budget  but if they think about getting a used tesla would it actually be worth it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25163,best car in a decade i am going to ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25164,i loved this review by marques but i have to disagree with the point made about the build quality  as a car enthusiast  i cannot look past the sheer lack of build quality when purchasing a 70 k car  i do not think anyone buying a 70 k mercedes is going to be okay with a poorly built interior  panel gaps and crappy adhesive for a  performance  wing  i love tesla for its innovation and its styling  dat cybertruck though xd  but they need to understand that consumers do not want to be complaining about issues that usually appear on cheaper cars like the nissan quest ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25165,tesla model s tesla model 3 tesla model y tesla model x nice elon,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25166,i would say you did not really state exactly why this is their most important car ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25167,damn i am about  70 000 short of being able to afford it,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25168,marques   the purpose of the card key  is just for starting the car   it does not need to be stay on the arm rest for the rest of the drive  the card key  is supposed to be like  tap  at arm rest and start the car like ignition  then put card back to the pocket and drive ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25169,i m a huge tesla fan  but they really need to improve the build quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25170,the build quality is kind of wack on every tesla car right when they start producing a new car  it always gets great after a few months though,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25171,not bothering me yet  love the y,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25172,brillo gorrilo they still can t get things right on the model s  and it s been 8 years  they don t care about quality control  why should they  when they haven t started losing sales to other automakers or can t keep up with demand ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25173,musk is no kiichiro toyoda  it seems tough to find balance  musk is all about pushing tech  and schedule  boundaries but not so much on qc  because that would hold back his insistence on doing things fast ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25174, kylehubb yeah tesla is starting to grow a cult following similar to apple where people buy their products without thinking twice  not complaining though  good for my stonks ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25175,our stonks this is russia baby   ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25176,there s a reason why they are priced the way they are  if model y had german level build quality it would be model x priced  well into six figures  you can t have your cake and eat it too,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25177, pigglywigglydeluxe hmmm  low expectations,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25178, pigglywigglydeluxe there are cars cheaper than model y and has much higher build quality  only reason to pay extra for a tesla is because of the batteries  do not include auto pilot  it is not completely ready and they are charging 8000  extra for it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25179, pigglywigglydeluxe are you seriously trying to justify the 70k price tag when such obvious qc issues exist  you would have a hard time funding such issues on a 10k hyundai  but elon s ultimate goal is to make e cars affordable around the 20 30k mark  if that happens then these minor issues can easily be looked over ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25180,khanh do not really  tesla has blown away my expectations of what electric cars can do  before the model s  everyone and i mean everyone laughed at tesla  now  tesla is a world standard on electric cars  with that said  now that tesla has established themselves among their peers of automakers  i think it s fair to scrutinize and analyze their products much like their competitors  it s not just an electric car with fancy tech with sub 3 second 0 70 times anymore  we are far beyond  my grandmother reacts to tesla launch  videos now  if we want to take tesla seriously we need to talk about their build quality ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25181,redemz i m not saying model y is appropriately priced  something is got to give  model y packs almost every feature and all the same power as model 3 which are industry leading to say the least  autopilot not withstanding  so if anyone expects to get all those features for 70k  there will be corners cut  most people don t seem to mind the qc woes because they get all other the great stuff that this car comes with  that makes sense  what i m simply saying is that if someone wants german level qc on a model y  you d be looking at model x pricing,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25182,raghunandan reddy c yes there are cheaper cars with better build quality that s very very true  however  you won t find a base hyundai sonata with the astounding level of tech and features  and power  as a tesla  features  price  quality  pick two  and only two ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25183, raghunandanreddyc they need to include autopilot to take autopilot driving data from their users and to continuously improve their software autopilot system  it would also be much more expensive than now when they are ready in the future ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25184, pigglywigglydeluxe its not good enough for a 70k car to have the qc of a sub 20k car  there is a reason why they continue to drop the price on their range every year  they too know that their pricing is far too high but for now there is not much they can do about it ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25185,thasmeer p i think they need to rename  autopilot  entirely because using that name implies the car drives itself which many people interpret as  oh it s ok this car has autopilot that means i can get behind the wheel drunk and tired ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25186,redemz don t they lose money on every car they sell  that if they wanted to be profiting on these cars they d have to price them way higher  the c8 corvette is roughly the same price with roughly the same qc level which i think is part of the reason why mclaren and porsche guys don t take corvette seriously  could the same level of scrutiny applied to tesla be understood between corvette and porsche ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25187,do you think it is build quality problem started when they opened their factory in china ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25188,bacon pancakes i doubt it  iphones and macbooks are made in china and those products seem to have phenomenal build quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25189, pigglywigglydeluxe gm is notoriously known for low quality products but even the corvette is leagues and bounds above anything tesla offers as far as qc is concerned ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25190, pigglywigglydeluxe nope  their quality has increased over recent years but they still have a long way to go,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25191,cyber truck has entered the chat ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25192,it always happens where there is a legion of fanboys  i can just hear them defending even the shoddiest job just because it is tesla ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25193,they are hiring manufacturing engineers to help solve some if these complex challenges  send in a resume ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25194, rdmz135 so right,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25195,i agree  the built quality will definitely affect my buying decision   i am a tesla fan but these small little details makes a big impression   the tech is awesome but if you do not get the basics right then it leaves a bad impression ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25196,right  even in this press car the rear seats are massively misaligned,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25197,addison martin they need to subcontract the manufacturing to toyota ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25198,parked my gti next to a model s p100d the other day and was blown away by the fact that my 26k dollar hatchback had tighter and more consistent panel gaps than a 100k plus dollar company flagship  not to mention my paint had less orange peel to boot  do not get me wrong  i love what tesla s doing in the market and the model s is a killer car  but it is insane to me that vw can pump out 20k dollar golfs with better panel gaps  paint  and fit and finish than a six figure luxury sedan they have had almost a decade to work the kinks out on in assembly and people seem to make excuses or just accept it  just puts a weird taste in my mouth  it reminds me of the flak porsche got for the taycan s price compared to the model s for the  same performance  it does nothing but tell me those people have never sat in a taycan  let alone a porsche product period  while it may be similar in performance  it is in an entirely different league  and you realize it after only 5 seconds of sitting inside one ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25199,as an addendum to what i said  this is not some baseless attack at tesla  there is lots of other large manufacturers that have inexcusable qc issues  cough ford s panel gaps cough  but having panel gaps i cannot put my thumb into and decent paint application are not some make or break thing from a budget perspective and they certainly are not excusable because tesla is  trying to make an attainable electric car  i feel the same way when i see that crap on a mustang as i do on a model 3 because i know hyundai can get it right on an accent that msrps at 15k brand new  a 75k dollar anything  regardless of manufacturer  should not have a spoiler that is not even adhered to the deck lid ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25200, pigglywigglydeluxe well it takes more steps to build a car than to build a smartphone  the more steps means the more probability of making a mistake each time ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25201,nick catelli most people would agree the standard is toyota lexus vehicles  why is a range rover so unreliable  it s a beautiful car but i would not trust it on a road trip ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25202,when tesla was still considered to be a startup shit like this could have slid  back then you bought tesla more to be part of the development anyway  not because you wanted the best car you could have gotten  but if they want be be considered a major car manufacturer competing with vw  toyota and co shit like this is unacceptable especially at this price point  i ve seen videos with model ys that we re missing paint  had broken tailgate lifters  broken interior panels and misaligned backpassenger doors  plus a fleeing spoiler in this video  i really wonder what the qc at tesla is doing these days,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25203, thomasbollenbach4525 completely agreed  you put up with things like this for a startup because they are doing their best to break into an extremely competitive market with a product you believe in  now though  it is hard to swallow seeing them still putting out cars with issues like this  and this is the car they knowingly gave a reviewer who was going to show it to millions of people on top of it  i know it is an early model and this has happened with other vehicles too  the preproduction c8 corvettes that reviewers got were objectively worse than cars customers ultimately got  panel gaps  poor transmission tuning  paint issues  fitment nvh problems  but they were admittedly preproduction by chevy and as said  the customer cars to date have been much better and all the problems tuning wise were worked out from what i have read  still though  this model y is from what i can tell production car  just an earlier run  not a preproduction review vehicle  for tesla to not send a ringer  hell  even just a car that was not blatantly falling apart in certain places with panel gaps i could shove my thumbs through to a high profile reviewer puts a real bad taste in my mouth  if they send marques a car with these issues knowing what he does  it makes me think what they might be sending to customers with the hope they will  overlook it because it is a tesla  i would not take delivery of one site unseen  and for all the bull that you have to deal with with dealerships  being able to look at a fleet of cars and inspect them before buying the one you want goes a long way when it comes to shit like this ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25204,well better fix before some other car company makes a better electric car  that might also be cheaper  only bad thing i did not like and the model 3 y it did not have agauge cluster and also not having cooling seats,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25205,you ain t wrong  tesla s are nice and all  but it would be much appreciated to have some physical buttons like the lights  windshield wipers  air vents  etc  it s not really ideal to have so many steps to change the flow of air when you can do it in one step ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25206,i am not going to be buying a tesla for a very loong time until they fix their quality of their cars becauase now it is just horrible panel gap and rust and a lot more i will keep to the big companies and by the way at 2 31 that is nothing new i hace that on my audi a4 from 2014,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25219,in the words of regular car reviews  the tesla model 3 is like the delorean  it s a pos  but it makes people go wow,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25220,damn i still don t think there shouldn t be so many cosmetic issues on a  70k vehicle lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25221,my same thought  should not that be a given at that price point  i do not like how mkbhd downplayed the issues saying he likes the positives of the car  having a gap allowing for water to enter the car is a deal breaker on my books ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25222,glen   well if he was given the car to review i m sure he wanted to keep it positive but i m happy he at least brought it to our attention,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25223,it is why if you do ever decide to buy one of these cars  any new tesla for that matter  from a tesla dealership  you always check for quality on the grounds of the dealership and make sure a report is done of every single issue  they should repair it for free so long as it was known that it was an issue left unfixed from the factory  tesla s have always been known for their cosmetic and build quality issues  so if you buy a tesla without knowing the issues you are committing yourself to  you will be in for a shock ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25224, zachary william yeah  i can appreciate that  mkbhd is a good reviewer,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25225,jake evan yeah i wonder how that works now that they are doing  hand free  delivery or whatever they call it  ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25226,glen   yeah i trust him and even if he doesn t specifically say it s a  negative  he still finds a way to put it in there so we know all the details,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25227,agreed  it is a huge issue  a  25k toyota is built so much better  i say toyota as all the cars of my family are toyotas   well  in fairness to tesla  they can still be considered babies in the auto industry  compared to these grandpas who mad decades to perfect the manufacturing process ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25228,be glad they are just cosmetic  that said  it is because musk is a harsh taskmaster with little patience   slow and steady wins the race  is anathema to him  he would be wise to switch to the early lexus model which was to take things slowly and really  really buckle down on production quality and user experience while being price competitive  now that they have the whiz bang tech stuff down  it is time for some buttons for the most basic features  wipers  radio  hvac  and tighter qc ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25229,  zachary cadena   contact less delivery  and you are welcome ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25230, kimoto504 tesla s are unreliable  it is not just cosmetic either ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25231,tesla mobile service and service  is generally very responsive to fixing everything you ask especially prior to delivery  while these issues shouldn t exist the car performs better than most cars in every other area  it s a trade off  i know because i ve owned 4 tesla  and cars from every major manufacturer  they all have their individual issues  none are perfect  y is awesome  i test drove it  recently  it doesn t feel as connected as my 3   and concur with marques overall insights ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25232, glendmd666 my dad has one and it does not have any of these gaps and the bad stuff  i think he got a bad model lol,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25233,had no issues with mine  but i do know that you can just tell tesla about any problems and they re drive someone out to wherever your car is parked and fix it for free ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25234,vinil shah reliability and durability are completely different from build quality,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25235,yep  i mean  not electric and not as fast but i had a crv recently and it had all these features right down to the memory lift gate and i paid under 30k for it  i am pretty sure the crv is bigger too ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25236,i think people buying a tesla know they are not getting the highest quality  car  they can get for the money  they are paying for the autonomous and battery tech   people mistake price point for luxury  it is literally just the coat of the battery motors lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25237,yea this is why you buy it first at the dealer,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25238,even at the tesla dealer i test drive the model 3 it had a little cosmetic errors but i do not it is worth  40k maybe  30k,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25252,i m not seeing the importance of the y  it s not any better than the model 3  sure it s bigger but that s more of a trim level thing  i m sure people would have no issue calling it a 3 wagon  it could ve been tesla s first 4x4 but no   to be honest i m not sure if any models are awd or 4x4  at 70k i m not seeing it other than brand recognition  i thought it would be priced to compete with a top end civic or at least the accord  if i had to buy a new electric car  call me crazy but i d get the mustang suv  it s going to be cheaper and sure to get looks regardless of how divisive it is ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25269,i always look forward to the quality of your content marques   whenever i see a video pop up i know it is something worth watching  i wish the volume of your intro and exit music was more normalized to your voice though   the difference was even more pronounced today with the unique acoustic challenges presented in a car cabin for this video   i find myself having to lower the initial volume and turn it back up as each video starts  or quickly skip a few seconds   is this just me   headphone user by the way ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25336,i love my model 3 so much but tesla really needs to work on their qc  honestly should be their  1 priority right now  i had 2 service appointments within the first week of owning my model 3  besides that though the car is amazing ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25337,what were those service appointments for  if you do not mind me asking ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25339,yeah  please share ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25340, whatastic i have had multiple on my model s for stupid things  i do not even have autopilot on my car and there was an autopilot malfunction message once  another time i could not turn on my ac for some random reason  the option was greyed out  and a few other times i have had other problems which i cannot remember  only thing i like is they service it for free  and if your car is stuck somewhere  mine would not turn on one time because i did not drive for a week  they come to where you are almost like a breakdown service ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25341,kable10 its like driving a range rover   i love my rr but it loves the service center more than it loves me ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25342,justplaysx every newer tesla has autopilot but not fsd  is that what you mean  i really hope you don t think you don t have autopilot when you do lol ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25343, jordan59961 bought my model s at end of 2016 and received it early 2017  not sure about now but they did not have autopilot for those models unless you spent  5000 extra ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25344,i love my tesla model x  the doors open without me touching them  when i am approaching with the fob in my pocket  the driver door opens for me  if i am coming from the front  it will pop open slightly  wait for me to walk past and then open all the way  it is one of my favorite features that gets used constantly  when my lease is up  i cannot imagine getting anything other than a tesla  not just because i love tech and think they are awesome cars  but i believe this company deserves our support and is doing great things for humanity  i drove 60mi earlier today  mostly on autopilot  the seats are super comfortable  it is like i am sitting in my favorite chair and watching the world move around me effortlessly  i would not trust any other system to work as well as tesla s ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25345,the model y is exactly what the market wants   it is relatively inexpensive   it has great range  and it is very comfortable and spacious  personally  i would prefer the model x because my main car is a jeep srt and i need the space   as much of it as possible    the model s is still my favorite because it is probably the fastest possible car you can buy under  100 000  in a quarter mile   even my hellcat charger cannot touch it in the quarter mile ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
25346, the car has matte black mkbhd   i will buy three of those ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]

25352,it s true  though  marques knows a lot about tech  but his car knowledge is limited since that s not his area of expertise given the history of this channel and his career  this doesn t mean it s bad  but marques  car reviews are very much different from traditional car reviewers   it focuses much more on tech and what mainstream buyers may care for  compared to traditional car reviewers who will go in depth into hp and torque figures  comment about grip and traction through corners  and possibly even show performance on a racetrack vs  another performance car priced around the same  different way of  reviewing  cars  basically  marques focuses more on tech  car reviewers generally focus more on driving dynamics ,[0 0 0 0 0 0]
