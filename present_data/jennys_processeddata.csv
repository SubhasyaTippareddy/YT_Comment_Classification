for competitive programming this is the best video on earth on dynamic programming 
batt ekdom sahi boli hain 
definitely bro  awesome teaching    thankyou so much for the lectures sis
i agree
check aditya verma
you are ashish birge
 deepakjoker4452 he is also nice
mam if i use tail recursion on the same fibonacci problem then will it give better complexity than dynamic programming approach   if no then why 
  actually universe bro
best video ever on dpp  
damn recursion is called dynamic programming   they give new name to frighten us  
more videos
please please please complete this dynamic programming series playlist              
please explain   team or country allocation  capital budgeting and stochastic production problems
thank you jennyy
love from      
please when n o there will be a call  so when n 5 there should be a call that will make the call 16 instead of 15 i stand to be corrected
well done 
ma am please do a video for matrix chain multiplication
usefull
best explanation i am mechanical engineer but i can understand easily
love you from mars  
after seeing your video it seems like i have understood javapoint website content but anyways programming means jenny mam for me and thankyou mam 
mam one doubt in a i a i 1 a i 2  in this loop if we pass 3 then it outcome is 3 1 3 2 2 1 3 only mam but you said array of 3 is 2
lots of love for you 
madam app konsa book ya konsa garde ka course pada rahi ha matlab 11the 12th garde or for bs  i am new
upload the videos on java programming mam
jenny  i love you
medam your voice is so nice 
good
best explanation i have seen
wowed 
wow madam first time i understood what is dynamic programming   you are great 
mam hinglish use kra karo request 
thanks to you i will pass for my exam     
very informative 
thank you madam
thanks
nan
your looking     and your explanation also  
is there any lectures on greedy and branch   bound  please help
i do not know how to thank you  just amazing work  god bless you  
such a great informative video madam  i am so greatful to you  
aree madamji white board ke saamne se toh hatt jaaya kro note down kaise karenge
your teaching style is very well  thanks for making all videos mam
good explanation
you are my favourite teacher
mam ap hindi me kyu nai batate
i am not felling good because i missed minimum edit distance tutorial on your channel 
hey your vedio is awesome  can you explain and make vedio on egg dropping dp problem
didi aap company me job krti ho
top notch 
love most of your videos apu  love you apuu  may god bless you 
mam  wish you 10 million subscribers  thank you for this playlist 
nice and most helpful tutorials
very helpful  thank you so much 
aajkal ache teacher sirf online hi milteh hai 
i love you mam you are looking godgeous
why it is called dynamic programming when we calculate all steps  the only difference is that results are stored   
teaching method is very good  
i am in bca 3rd sem or ye sab 4th sem me aane wala hai me abhi hee sikh raha hu 
mam please let me know what are the prerequisites needed to learn dp  do we need to have before knowledge of dsa                   mam please reply
in dynamic programming can we say now the time complexity is o n 
jenny   codewithharry   gurrented placement  
please make one video on how to prepare for top product based companies  like faang 
at the start you mentioned dp is used for solving optimization problems    5 40  finding nth fibonacci number is not an optimizatiojn problem  so no point in saying its solution has optimal substructure property  why give fibonacci number as an example of dp  
precise  to the point  very well explained  the best thing about your videos is they are so simple to understand  amazing work  liked  subscribed  and will be shared 
greedy approaches also very useful in placement and gate start them
also start backtracking please
hi jenny  for every other dp problem we need to create a table in somewhat different way like in some example we take the value of upper row and in some problem we are taking the value of the same row  and in some example we are starting with  0  index and not in other  is there any logic behind it  and is there are any finite set of way to create this respective table because if we are able to create the table in correct way we can create the logic easily  please let us know about it 
any iterative loop using array can be the example of dynamic programming 
world s best youtube channel     only 1 video me mere sare doubt clear ho gye  thnks madam
jenny mam  i owe my success to you  you are the weapon against coaching mafia online class 
anwar from sialkot pak
thanks a lot madam  these are the best lectures explained in the simplest way 
interesting  thank you
i am a slow learner but this vid gives me a good idea about dp  thanks
thanks madam
thanks for such good explanation  best luck and good wishes from afghanistan 
need pdf
the way you are giving the theories is golden madam 
wonderful  keep it up amazing job dear    
super explanation  one of the best dp videos online
this is the problem i cannot focus 
dp is actually  optimized recursion  or you can say its a second name for  recursion  it is basically solving a problem recursively  by giving an  inductive definition  to the problem  it is a step ahead of plain recursion in that sense that we  optimize the complex recursive program  having multiple nested recursions  by eliminating repetitive calls to the recursive functions  the approach to problem solving in dp is same as that of recursion 
mam bht jada ad hai  mam aapka hi video me jada ad aata hai    you tube ko sara kammai aaphi ke channel se kar na hai 
please make some videos on recursion in java
so  we have to implement programming for each key value pair in dictionary for memoization in python 
thanks a lot jenny mam
great explanation and analogies  dil emoji dil emoji 
started from the bottom  now we are here started from the bottom  now my whole team here
obviously i am not from india  can anybody tell me what is cs it net jrf  
madam  can you make some video series on oops
mam can you tell me is my program correct or not  package dynamicfibonacci  import java util scanner   public class dynamicfibonacci       static int count 0      static int memo    new int short max value      public static int fib int num                if memo num 0              return memo num          count          if num 0              return 0          if num 1              return 1          int sum   fib num 1 fib num 2          memo num    sum          return sum             public static void main string  args                scanner sc   new scanner system in          system out println enter a number          while sc hasnextint                        sc nextline                    int num sc nextint          int result fib num          system out println fibonnaci of  num     result  within  count  count                       
mam can you start teaching for any programming language
much better explanation for dynamic programming than anyone from earth  
hi  professor jenny  i really love your dynamic programming lectures  could you explain some tree graph linklist  problems 
 
amazing  video  love from pakistan   i need a heart from uuuu
can yoy make the series on django
can you know what is you are gate score
 cs dojo
mam make video on backtracking i am  preparing for nqt please upload in one week because i can easily understand by your teaching
python programming pa lecture karin
thank you mam
jenny  
binod
to reduce space complexity why cannot we have a hashet unordered list and store the index n  as key and value as the result 
mam please make videos on back tracking and greedy algorithm also
finally understood what dynamic programming is  thanks to uh mam 
mam can you please upload videos of daa all topics
nice one jenny  for the bottom up approach  do not we need an array of length 2  because at any time for fib n  we need fib n 1  and fib n 2  only two elements 
thanks for this video  far better and easier to understand than other available videos of top competitive programmers 
thank you very much jenny 
madam please make videos on codevita problem solving in python  
make videos on daa  cse 5th sem 
madam thankyou so so much 
well taught madam keep going if possible take some codechef problems too
awesome  nice explanation  thanks for your efforts    i have one question  i developed 9x9 random sudoku with 81 nested loops  now i want to implement a 25x25 sudoku with a to y letters  but i do not think we can implement it with 625 nested for loops as maximum depth  now a days in c are150  nested fors i believe  so based on any dynamic programming concepts  can we achieve it with any combination of iteration recursion calls 
have you figured out how to do this and if so  how 
hi jenny your videos are pretty cool and more crystal clear  can suggest how can i make videos in english   i am also a teacher but i teach the students using regional language with english i am very nervous to be complete english spoken
awesome voice    for teaching
madam which camera phone do you use for recording the lectures  
mam if am not wrong few days ago there were 27 videos in this playlist  did you deleted other  
really awesome do not know this  memoization  concept before thanks a lot 
i love it  you r great  
can you provide us full code in any language
i love her  the best videos for competitive programming  i am sorry that i did not find her videos earlier 
ma am  your lectures are very useful  thank you madam to spread knowledge among us in free of cost  
thanks madam
jenny  could you please start making videos on tree  b w you videos are amazing  thank you 
hands down  the fear of dp is gone after jenny s lectures  she has such a beautiful way of putting things  
mam i have code to find all permutation using backtracking  but did not understand completely how it works  could you please explain by making video  import java util arraylist  import java util arrays  public class permutation       public static void main string  args            int  input    1 2 3 4 5          permutation input                     returns all the permutations of elements of the given array         param input            public static void permutation int  input          arrays sort input          permutation input new arraylist  new boolean input length                     returns all the permutations of elements of the given array         param input         param partial contains the partial permutation         param used uses flags to indicate whether or not the element at the given index is used or not            public static void permutation int  input  arraylist  partial  boolean  used            if  partial size    input length                system out println arrays tostring partial toarray              return                    for  int i   0  i < input length  i                if  used i     i > 0   input i    input i   1     used i   1                    used i    true                  partial add input i                  permutation input  partial  used                  used i    false                  partial remove partial size    1                                 
please also explain the difference between greedy algo   dynamic programming  because i have read this same problem in greedy algo   again the concepts which i have studied about greedy algorithm is also same as you taught in this lecture 
mam your teaching is very good  we can understand easily  be continue mam 
please upload lectures on compiler design  lockdown mein at least kuch to padhunga 
i love all your video it is so simple 
mam i love youuuu 
why cannot we use top down approach in dp as you said    and you r using bottom up approach in iterative approach but if we use iterative we do not need to store the result into array   we can obtain the result with storing into array with o n  time complexity   pl explain    and why did not you use recursive approach with bottom up approach  
just understood the concept dynamic programming what exactly it is   thank you mam a lot           
best introduction  thanku mam   big fan 
till now the best video on dynamic programming i have seen on youtube  thanks a lot  
mam  please explain backtracking and recursion  how to write that programs unable to imagine i am totally dependent on you 
what is inside you   even dp looks easy after listening from your lecture 
dynamic programming   making simple problems into complex one  hahah  nice explanation
you r too good madam it made easy for me to understand the dp
can you reduce the number of ads which appears on the whole video
madam where is assembly line scheduling als  please make a tutorial on this topics
unknowingly i used memoization while creating n level derived tables in sql server using dynamic sql  nice to hear that it is called memoization 
hi jenny mam r you working somewhere
love you madam  buety and brain   plz date pe chalona madam plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
thank you 
thanks mam  bcz of you today i got job
beauty with brain
mam please explain backtracking  greedy algorithms  thanks in advance mam
you da best
this was really good  please  do not  change 
    glorious teacher i also want to learn dynamic memory allocation  great problem solver you are also i think me too fan ho gaya aap ka 
what i have observed is that  jenny s  always covers  time    complexity which other videos do not    hats off to jennys  
saw your video for the starting 1 minute  exponential time complexity solution for travelling salesman problem exists but can you solve it in a better way using dynamic programming   dynamic programming can be used to reduce the time complexity of solving some optimization problems from exponential to linear time using memoization techniques by storing the solution to repetitive sub problems 
one of best channels for data structures and algorithms on youtube madam could you also make a playlist on algorithms 
thanks mam you explained it very nicely can you please make more videos on dp
seriously  best explanation of dp 
thank you madam for this video because this is the very first video where i totally understood the concept whatever you provided because i have seen lots of tutorial on youtube but their video is not understandable 
please post video on weighted interval scheduling  did not understand the topic  thanks
def fib n arr         if n in  0 1             return 1       if arr n >0 > memorization check            return arr n    output  fib n 2 arr fib n 1 arr    arr n output   > memorization    return output if  name main      n int input      arr 0 n 1  since one extra for fib starts from zero     print fib n arr 
education is road to heaven and free useful eduction hard to get i cannot even spell eduction
easy to understand  excellent work and respect for your explanation
nice explanation 
i just  watch your first video and now i am watching your whole channels videos  you are the best 
finally understood dynamic programming
 
finally got an idea of dynamic programming    thank you so much
mam plz bring last yr net questions on dis topic
just redirected to dynamic programming and it is really helpful for me in preparing for my assignments  thank you so much madam  your tutorials are helping a lot of students
wonderful video  i simply loved the way you explained the dp and examples you have shown are more than enough to visualize it  feel free to ping me for any kind of your help as a viewer response  i will be happy to help you 
really very good explanation
  beauty with brain  very well explained  just loved the way you were teaching  
thanks for covering why we need dynamic programming  i will also recommend some diagrams with graphics 
please upload video for graph
madam it is wonderful plsss do videos on strings it is storing  pattern matching algorithm plss
jenny  the way you explained is just amazing 
few people have the charm to make people fell in love with them in first sight and i really fell in love the way she is i know it seems creepy and i personally do not like  it and do it but yhan main pighal gya sry madam 
please give more examples such that coin exchange problem  ladder problem
excellent  exceptional work  
i feel myself fortunate enough to find your video  thanks again 
your lectures are easy to understand  thank you for your support miss

 deepak  pls ping me some other content as well to prepare karumanchi book completely  it would be a great help to me  thanks in advance 
minimun coin problem   
oh my fucking god i can clearly see wtf this is and this is who gets us the jrf huh why on earth is india like this  by the way good work mam  you look like a real qt pie 
explanation is really good and easy to understand  thanks for the video 
best video tutorial to start dynamic programming <3
great work jenny  loved it  
i watched all your dynamic  programming videos  excellent work and respect for you mam  please make a video on minimum edit distance problem 
for competitive programming this is the best video on earth on dynamic programming 
batt ekdom sahi boli hain 
definitely bro  awesome teaching    thankyou so much for the lectures sis
i agree
check aditya verma
you are ashish birge
 deepakjoker4452 he is also nice
mam if i use tail recursion on the same fibonacci problem then will it give better complexity than dynamic programming approach   if no then why 
  actually universe bro
is  that  memo n   or  memo n 1    
well  hoping to reach your subscribers by o 2   n  haha 
loved you are explanation
kon kon yahan thumbnail dekh k aaya  lmao
make detailed videos according to gate syllabus so that it will be helpful to crack any cse exam or any interview as well 
 1
upload videos for competitive programming
please do upload videos for gate exam as per syllabus 2020  you are explanation is very good  please upload more videos for gate
waiting for another part of dynamic programming in this channel 
start uploading  you can watch few videos now  more are in queue
you are very very beautiful  and your explanation is far more beautiful 
mam me apka fan ho gaya  apka pura naam
i m speechless    you are explanation is just amazing   
thank you mam  you are a great teacher 
didi your explanation is really epic also please upload videos related to competitive programming 
hope your channel grows exponentially  i finally understand the difference between the two dp approaches  ty
mam please make videos on backtracking    
agree
can i get your instagram     
these days perverts and idiots can also be seen on the educational platforms 
thank you mam   keep uploading
mam  yrr way of explanation and technique of solving the problem is extraordinary  thank you so much 
thank you so much it is in my course    love you keep it up
thank you  you r a vary good teacher  
correction   16 20 in coin 5 and weight 6 intersection it should be 2  at coin 5 and weight 11 intersection it should be 4  at coin 10 and weight 6 intersection it should be 2  in coin 10 and weight 11 intersection it should be 4  i hope you guys got this correction   
yes mam
code you have written will give a segmentation fault as you are referring to the index of a i 1  and i is 0  thanks 
can you post the code if possible as iam unable to write the code for the first row
thanks for this video  but you have mistake in first for loop  you cannot have <  but only < index i will be out of range  and i think is better not store the value of 0  if you have many coins and important mistake is you need implement logic for first coin without it is all logic useless  thanks another once you r really great teacher  you r explanations skills are rare     if you have patreon or somethink like this you can send me link i consider donation to you  i wish you good healt in this difficult times   my code here  but without you are explanation for me inst possible make it xd   def domatrix coins price      twodimensional    0    price for i in range len coins      for i in range len coins          for j in range price              if i   0                  if  j 1    coins i    0                      twodimensional i j    1                 else                      twodimensional i j    0             else                  if coins i  > j   1                      twodimensional i j    twodimensional i 1 j                      continue                 if j   1   coins i    0                      twodimensional i j    1   twodimensional i 1 j                      continue                 if j   1   coins i  > 0                      twodimensional i j    twodimensional i 1 j    twodimensional i j coins i      print twodimensional  coins    2 3 5 10  domatrix mince2 15 
 xavierxavier97  hi mince 2 means 
 swetas6431 coins
i think so when you are applying the nested loop it will throw an exception because of the reason the index  1  would never exist  20 57

i think for dynamic programming best video lecture available in youtube is     am list pl z 8caslpwekqhdcpmfohnchwz8ty2go  only con is video is in hindi i have followed all the video and he explains the underlying concept behind the problem instead of just saying the solution like jenny lectures 
 kushagraagarwal3297 i think we can just check for i 0   if w is a multiple of coins i    then a i j    1
mam for i   0 a i 1  raise error
you just solved my problems  the problem is related to 0 1 knapsack  but the video is too long please take small number examples so that we can understand it better     public static int knapsackcoinchange int  coins  int sum            int n   coins length             1 because the indexing start from 0          int  dp   new int n   1 sum   1          for  int i   1  i <  n  i                for  int j   1  j <  sum  j                      compare current weight and current capacity if difference between capacity and weight different is  ve                 if  coins i   1  > j                        dp i j    dp i   1 j                    else                         weight is equal to capacity or less than capacity then find the max and put the val                      dp i j    math max dp i   1 j  coins i   1    dp i   1 j   coins i   1                                                    return dp n sum

mam your explantion is as beautiful as you  
better to explain first what is the logic behind this solution  also there is no check for out of bound index for the first row when i   0 
thank you for explaining the great tricking dynamic programming to all  your explanation made it easy   kudos great work  
excellent video  but i do have one suggestion  although the algorithm part is perfectly executed but for the coding part  i think we should avoid using a matrix  table  for calculation  because when we think about it  for calculating one particular row  we only need the previous row  and the rows behind were just taking extra space for no reason  python program       def change self  amount  int  coins  list int   > int          dp    0     amount 1          dp 0    1         for c in coins              for i in range c  amount 1                  dp i    dp i c          return dp 1  we also do not really need to check for condition  because  just by following the procedure  everything aligns automatically  so conclusion  by using a single dimenstional array instead of a matrix  we can reduce the space complexity from o m   n   where  m  is the range from  0 amount  and  n  is the no of coins that are given to us  to o m  hope it helps  there is a leetcode problem on the name coin change   ii  so practice that too for further clearity 
mam  i have doubt  in else cond  j coins i 1  is working instead of i alone  can you explain that part once in chat 
explained with enormous patience 
the table format of 2  3  5 10 is wrong in middle  please solve it on your own but her method is correct it takes our 30 minutes to identify this error  thanks
nice explanation
thanks madam 
thanks mam finally i understand the coin change problem       
thanks a lot apu  it is great for understanding
love you   never meet a teacher such clearly and good 
int coinchange int  coin  int coinsize  int index  int count  int amount  	if count >  amount   index > coinsize  		return  count   amount  1   0  	 	int y   coinchange coin  coinsize  index 1   count coin index  amount  	int n   coinchange coin  coinsize  index 1  count  amount  	 	return y n    first call index 0   count   0
what if we can not use the same number more than one time  
atm is the good example which uses this algorithm
full java code  but you can easily understand  she only giving code for the 3 5 10 coins but for 2th coins many people do not understand even i too first here is the correct code will work  class solution       public int change int amount  int  coins            int  a   new int coins length amount 1          for int i   0 i<coins length i                        a i 0 1              for int j   1 j< amount j                                if coins i >j                                        if i 0                                                a i j    0                        else                                               a i j    a i 1 j                                          else                                       if i 0                                                a i j    a i j   coins i                        else                                               a i j    a i 1 j    a i j coins i                                                                          return a coins length 1 amount         
sorry but your video does not simplify the topic instead make it complex 
a 5 6 2
i understand the algorithm steps  but still i am not getting why we take the number of ways to get the current amount minus the current coin value 
hats off to you mam  literally you are far far better teaching from our college professor to whom we are paying lakhs of rupees  bow down for your deliberate teaching and the way you are teaching  if this kind of teaching we going to get we will definitely fall in love with dsa daa 
super mam i i will become a best professor award in my college  really you i will helping me a lot  very much big fan of your work thank you once again mam 
so we are supposed to manually enter the first row and the first column and then the code fills in the rest of the table based on those  right 
madam 6 5 wala index 2 value ana thaa
thanks jenny  this is the best video i have seen on this topic 
thank you for the explanation 
thank you so much mam  i watched this video in almost four channels but i was not able to get a proper idea about how to proceed but your explanation made it very easy for me to understand
happy to help
thank you  helped me solve project euler nos 76   77 in less than 1 10 ms run time  
thank you madam  wonderfully explained 
so happy mam thank you soooooo much      god bless you   
madam why you reduced numbers of column from total 16  0 15  to total 8  0 7  while writing logic for this  please anyone reply

very nice  thank you 
great explanation  thanks a lot jenny 
one doubt  for coin value 3 and w   2  how can we say 1  because if we exclude coin then the w will be zero or else if we include coin then the w will become 3  so it  seems there there  is no say  so it should be zero as the matrix cell value for this combination  am i correct 
what if i   0 
 simple rule   d you need to explain why  with examples  had to watch another video to understand what you were saying 
you are a very good lecturer  bravo and thanks  i am off home now to code this in c  thank you

you are my jesus 
pure gold  i just subscribed 
thanks mam
thank you very much  your lectures are best and really save my algorithms course at university  without your lectures  i will probably fail my course  can you pls make vedios on backtracking algorithms and related problems like n queens and sudoku in the future   thank you for your great lectures 
i love you
akka semma ka  
thank you mam   have one concern how it is related to target sum
10 25 why the rule  how did you derive the rule
thanks mam
very clear  no hesitation  really understandable  love this lecture  thank you for creating a great videos    
its so useful  thank you so much
thansk a lot mam
thank you mam   please keep it up   you are really great  
if am not wrong  your solution need o collection of coin required weight  space  is there any way to get to o required weight   
logic is correct 90  but for the 1st case coin j >0 than i 1 ie 0 1 is  1 and this will fail the program  something required their
you are amazing  it is enjoyable how you teach these concepts in a so simple way 
why include condition comes by sub j coins i    can you clarify  how did you derive that formula 
amazing explanation  keep up the good work 
i have never seen a more clear explanation for this popular problem  i would wish to have all my instructors like you back in time  now i stand and clap this great instructor  thanks 
thanks
great content 
if you want to understand dp check aditya verma s dp series that is the best series you will ever watch on dp
you are the best  you explained this so clearly  it was so helpful that you explained what the rows  columns  and what each cell represented as well as the strategy for calculating the values  i was so confused when my professor lectured about it  but in so little time  i learned a lot from you   thanks so much 
can anyone say time complexity for this 
madam can you make a video on the eurodiffusion problem statement
thanks   
jenny s lectures cs it net jrf   why are we imposing a new rule that if coinvalue> w  just copy above value  why   if coin is 3 and w is 2  we do not have any way to make 2  then why are we copying above value which is  1 
also  explain  why  you just can not randomly pick any column value anywhere  there should be reason behind that 
mam aapko dekhe ya video dekhe
damn   why cannot i hit the  like  button twice  
tq sister
i want to thank you for explaining why amount 0 is always 1  i have watch other videos and they never explain it the way you do  thank you very much 
why is it 1 
thank you mam and for those who are saying they did not get this explanation try to concentrate on board more everything here is crystal clear     
this is super helpful  especially the exclusion and inclusion part  keep up the good work 
wow  you are an amazing teacher  thank you 
madam clear nahi hua bilkul bhii  aur cut video mein concept  clear hi nahi horahaa
how can we make sum   2 using a 3 denomination coin    i mean we simply copied 1 from denomination 2 to denomination 3 s row in sum  2   how is that possible 
wonderful explanation pls do include such videos

really nice explanation
thanks you so much madam  solid explanation plz add more video in this playlist madam 
how can we get the first row value 
madam  thankyou for clearing concepts 
why are you saying ao repeatedly  nice explanation but your ao was annoying  no offense 
thank you very much  this  was extremely helpful  d
great explanation mam  you did clear everything 
great explanation of the algorithm but this algorithm can be implemented using one dimensional array like this  static int coinproblem int  denominations  int amount    		int  sol   new int amount   1  		sol 0    1  		for  int den   denominations    			for  int i   den  i < amount  i    				sol i    sol i sol i   den  			  		  		return sol sol length   1  	 
very easy explanation 
very nicely explained
i am in love with you 
you are the best jenny  thank you 
madam you are super awesome  thank you for the content    
when they ask you how much money you have in your bank account  8 21 
i think there is a mistake in row 3 column 6  it should have been 2 not 3  we take the value above 2 tablet 2   6 5 
thanks for sharing 
i write very few comments on youtube  but really your work is commendable  jai ho jenny didi ki   
beautifully explained  appreciate your work madam 
how can we calculate the condition when w  1 and coin value is 2 how we are getting the value 0 
perfect explanation of backtracking  thank you <3
thankyou   
this problem looks like a simple dp when we see the question  but it is not  because the other problem where we find the minimum no  of coins to use is lot easier 
your is giving wrong ans for 3  2 3 5 sum   9 ans   3
sorry my bad
your videos are too big please try to make short one 
that fly realy wannted to learn about dynamic programming
finally  i saw smile in her face    22 30   just kidding    superb explanation madam
i genuinely loved the approach of tushar roy in the same problem 
there is no meaning to mug up some random method  just because it gives the answer  an explanation behind the method should be given  and not doing some bodmas operation without any logic 
mam please explain maximum ribbon cut problem also
thank you for the simple explanation really appreciate that
mam if there are 50 notes whose total value is 100 rupees but without taking 2 rupee do not take 3 rupeee or 4  6 7 8 9 because they are not real rupees plese slove my problem
plz switch on off for you and me
a 5 6 2 mem plz check a i j  on 22 30
there are no 3 rs coins in reality  so like question asked in some administration post interviews to check presence of mind  we can have different answers at different type of interviews
thank you so much jenny  much love and respect for you and all indians from egypt
the base case does not make any sense  watched ton of videos and never clicked      7 50   you have  2 and want to make zero total  the answer is one   i do not get it  you cannot make total 1 out of  2 but you can make 0 out of  2  my brain  
 gfg 
thanks
tysm mam it was very helpful of you to explain so deep  please keep explaining such algorithmic questions  <3
also in the first for loop their should be    i  < len coins   
thanks a lot madam your explanation is very good and helpful for us
the way you algos madam is  really amazing
really formula looks to scary but you explained it in observation method salute  regards from ld college of engineering  
mam can you give the source code of this question 
we get a sum of 0 by not choosing 2 in one way and we get a sum of 1 in 0 ways why not just do not use 2  would not that make it one way 
the question is why cannot i concenterate on board 
how we get sum 0  by selecting one 2 rupie coin  first column all should be  0 right 
is there any three rupees coin
maybe this solution has a problem of double counting  like for a value of 3  1 2 1 is different from 1 1 2  i might be absolutely wrong in concluding this  please correct me if i am wrong 
mam what is the time complexity of this algo 
o n  as dp brings recursive algo o 2 n  to o n 
you and your way of teaching are just awesome  great explanation   thanks for it      
thank you mam   for such kind of explanation  but my question is how did you get the logic behind this problem
thank you jenny   my afternoon was well spend   
you come with a certain rules but you did not explain the how you came up with those rule
it is a technique actually
 dipchakraborty71 no dude   there is a reason behind the technique go and check back to back swe channel problem has been explained clearly
 vijayj1997 exactly
please expain madam what if we are taking permutation of coins in each change  then how many ways be there
voice  
was it just me or did anyone else check if there is a fly in front of your monitor
give 3 real life application example of coin change problem  any one 
what is coins  length of here
i would add a bit of tech background on the 3 items  exclude include add  thanks anyways for the explanation
nice explanation 
thank you so much madam  i missed my ada lecture  then i found your videos  very useful for me 
you only explained the logic  but why we are going back and taking val i j  that is not explained
instead of a program  try if need to do in manually how you will do it
good explanation thanks madam 
thank you   your explanation helped me alot for understanding of logic clearly 
thank you  
by seeing to your face   our concentration is missing   
please share link of previous video
great explanation madam  a suggestion  your video can be better if you start with providing the intuition to the solution  
using 1d array def coinchange s m n      arr    0 for x in range n 1      arr 0    1     for i in range m          for j in range s i n 1              arr j    arr j s i       return arr n   def main      s  list map int input enter the coin array strip split      m   len s      n   int input enter the main amount      result   coinchange s  m  n      print result    if  name main      main

great video madam
ek baat toh man ni padegi dynamic programming m space complexity ki maa chud jati hai
i have a doubt in the algorithm part if  a  i   > j    and what if i 0 we have no row above the first row so it will not give the right answes
10 00  the shortcut if coin value > sum then just copy the above value this is the simple trick  this is the simple rule  this is where i get lost  the rest of the video seems to heavily rely on this  trick  but i just cannot deduce where this comes from  i see some other comments in the video from people that also seem to not be able to follow from this part  some replies mentioned another video of yours and even other people but i still do not get where the formula comes from
correct  even i also got stuck in same place   jenny   you should 1st explain the logic behind this problem that how to deduce the formula instead of just writting the code using formulas 
thanku so much mam ji

great explanation thank you mam 
your explanation is just awesome   cleared my all doubts related to this topic  and one more thing you have a beautiful dipper eyes
expecting more videos related to dynamic programming or coding related problems 
respect for this lovely lady when she ignored the fly lmao

it is not about fill the table   it about the recursive relation and base case   it is like you are tracing the solution  you can see this video    am list pl z 8caslpwekqhdcpmfohnchwz8ty2go
best all covering tutorial
thank you so much  you really helps me in preparing for my test    
nice explanation
thank you so much  greetings from greece 
would you do the code for us to print all the possible combinations
mam once see rs 5 line with amount 6 it gives 6 5 1 so 0 2 2 but you are placed 3 mam
keep up the hard work
after watching your expressions  it seems that you are teaching in front of a gun  do not get scared  always smile 
focus on studying  not the face 
mam your way of teaching dp is great plz make more videos 
can we do it in  o n  space
very well explained 
denomination of 5 in sum 6 is wrong and  also denomination of 10 in sum of same  am i right 
superb miss
please make more videos on dynamic programming problems  
madam can you tell me that in the first loop why did you write  i< coins  length  why length 
mam pls provide you are contact no 
and what if the combination is not possible
i have doubt  what about the first row that is for coins of 2   you have written logic for the row 2 3 4 but not for first one
thank you   you way teaching is awesome  i like it
mam   what would be the logic if we also want to print all possible 9 ways to print weight 15 
madam              according to your logic if i consider arr 0 1  which j value is 1 and less then coin 0  that is 2  then it will return value of arr 1   1  which does not exist then it will show error  plz justify my question

this does not work  i   1 with a starting count of 0 indexes the array at  1 
got any solution  
so true man
yeah  how to handle the base case 
i think you must have to make 0 row before coin 2 in starting   otherwise how would you do for 2>1    a 0 1 1    if 0 will already be there   it will take the value from above row

i love you really i do not even understood this video because i was watching you whole heartedly plz will you be my valentine i have also planned our family  if boy the name will be jack and if girl name will be angelina bye love you sexy
thank you for this step by step guide  i was struggling to understand how to formulate the table but i think i grasped it now 
thanks a lot  
your code will give a segmentation fault when i 0 as it is accessing i 1 explanation is really nice  thanks  correct code    for int i 0 i<m i      table i 0 1           for int i 0 i<m i                for int j 1 j< n j                       if coin i >j              table i j i 0 0 table i 1 j                           else             table i j i 0 0 table i 1 j table i j coin i                              
in else block for i 0 table i j table i j coin i  i think
in the if loop there is a ambiguity for me   if i and j are 0 then how a 0 1   0  will store in a 0 0 
 include  int main void    	int n i   	printf enter no of coins  	scanf d n  	int coins n  	for i 0 i<n i  	scanf d coins i  	int amount scanf d amount  	int j a n amount 1  	for j 0 j<n j  	  		a j 0 1  	  	for i 0 i< amount i  	  		if i coins 0 0  		a 0 i 1  		else 		a 0 i 0  	  	printf n  	for i 1 i<n i  	  		for j 1 j< amount j  		  			if coins i >j  			a i j a i 1 j  			else 			  				 				a i j a i 1 j a i j coins i  			  		  	  	for i 0 i<n i  	  		for j 0 j< amount j  		  		 printf d  a i j  		  		printf n  	  	printf d a n 1 amount  	 	  
you should also explain how did you get this approach rather than just showing the pattern in the table 
for an explanation of why refer to her video where she talks about the  why   
the question is  why  how to derive this in the interview  without knowing the way beforehand 
that is the main question lol
what she said should be enough  i guess you could try tracing the recursive tree and see the subproblems which overlap  then you can just store those subproblems in an array  but for all i know  in all dp  this is the norm  find the overlapping subproblem and store it  for future access
exactly 
for an explanation of why refer to her video where she talks about the  why   
you guys ever thought what can be application of this is real life  if no  checkout     this video will hit you for sure 
     go check it out for inituition behind the logic
duniya hi scam hai  
intuitively you can say that the no  of ways of amt x    no  of ways of amt  x  without using the current coin   no  of ways using the current coin so in no  of ways using current coin it is obvious that current coin  is included  so now we remove the coin value from that amt so new amt become  amt   val now we calc the  amt  val  using the coins till current value which is why we trace back j valur by coins i  i know this sounds a bit confusing
thank you
wonderful way of explaining this question hope you make more videos on dp   thanks much <3
in love with your expressions 
not understanable confusing at line 5 coin
 tell then bye bye takecare   lovelyy
dhansu explaination  keep it up  
your method of teaching is well so kindly send me your number  agi want you
you are very cheese bachi will you marry me
good explanation   int coins     2 3 5 10  int w   10  int dp    new int w 1  dp 0    1  for int i 1  i < dp length  i      dp i    0    for int i 0  i < coins length  i      for int j 1  j<dp length   j          if coins i  <  j              dp j    dp j    dp j coins i                    system out println dp w 
i think dsa  specifically dp  is the only part in coding where most of it professionals lack skills to code because most of the teachers are not able to explain clearly  but through your videos  you can help every young it professional to understand these concepts better
wow  wish you would have made them almost one year ago i would have scored 100 100 in dsa still thanks  pls keep making such useful videos great method of explaining            
5 38 the insect got no chill  the video was good 
solved from you this is lit   thanks for helping us
thanks jenny   that was an awesome explaination indeed    
thank you so much
thanks 
thank you madam  love from gujarat 
just solved this on leetcode without a hitch thanks to this perfect explanation   if everyone were smart and a babe like jenny the world would be a better place

mein mechanical ka student  hun   tab bhi meine purre video dekhe yeah hee hai mere saath kal raat ko  mein aaj tak channel mute karke dekh rha tha 
please  use this line  a 0 j     j   coins 0    0    1   0 before starting the for loop 
thanks for such a clear explanation  and detail walk through of the problem 
thank you so much
it was really helpful  thank you so much
i already know this  still watched full video  just because the way you teach it  thank you  please keep on uploading make studying interesting 
how do we do if coins are duplicate   is it possible using dynamic programming
dear madam you r just awesome 
madam thank you so much your lecture really helped me understand the algorithm behind this problem  though i was able to implement the algorithm i still have one doubt as to what was the logic behind including the coin step  though i was able to implement it but could not understand it very well  thanks 
12 52 when you are saying fine  this is the best style i have ever seen  just enjoying your way of teaching 
you doing great job please make a video on how should crack the interview of product based company
gazab
is this your name jayanti khatri lamba
yes
very good explanation
thanks mam
yes mam video must be small  max 15 mins
nice explanation mam i understand the logic clearly and here is the code in  python 3   print enter the coins   enter the numbers like this 2 3 5 10 a list map int input split  print sum should be  s int input   enter number like this 15 ar    0 for x in range s 1  for x in range len a  for i in range 0 len a      for j in range 0 s 1                   if i 0 and j 0              ar i j 1         elif i>0                  ar i j ar i 1 j ar i j a i          elif ar i j 0                   ar i j ar i j a i  print number of ways are ar len a 1 s    input 2 3 5 10            15 output  9
great video
nice explanation and thanks for the video  but i would like to point some corrections in the psuedo code that you have mentioned you should add one more case where in  if the first denomination is 1 then all the values in the first row will be the same as the j value and also the first row should be intialised  before the for loop if in case the first denomination is not 1 
hi jenny  the explanation is very good  but i think  this logic will not work as in for loop you are initializing i   0 and j  0 and in if else block you are using a i 1    a j 1   if i will start with i  1 and j  1  how can i get the first row values   can you please help here
mam you are the best   very very gud method of teaching keep uploading more and more vedeos
please make a complete series on dynamic programming i have scourged the internet and you are by far the best please help students in understanding such concepts thank you so much 
few are covered and working on   pls check my videos and playlist for more
 
how are you getting 3 for column 6 row 3  1   bring down the value above which is 2   2  6 5  1 so 2 the value in column 1 which is 0 equals 2 not 3 
you are the only one who saw the mistake
this problem looks like a variation on the 0 1 knapsack problem
perfect 
good explanation main logic is clear but how to the make first row in program  that 1 0 1 0 1 0 kind of 
correction   16 20 in coin 5 and weight 6 intersection it should be 2  at coin 5 and weight 11 intersection it should be 4  at coin 10 and weight 6 intersection it should be 2  in coin 10 and weight 11 intersection it should be 4  i hope you guys got this correction   
yes mam
code you have written will give a segmentation fault as you are referring to the index of a i 1  and i is 0  thanks 
can you post the code if possible as iam unable to write the code for the first row
thanks for this video  but you have mistake in first for loop  you cannot have <  but only < index i will be out of range  and i think is better not store the value of 0  if you have many coins and important mistake is you need implement logic for first coin without it is all logic useless  thanks another once you r really great teacher  you r explanations skills are rare     if you have patreon or somethink like this you can send me link i consider donation to you  i wish you good healt in this difficult times   my code here  but without you are explanation for me inst possible make it xd   def domatrix coins price      twodimensional    0    price for i in range len coins      for i in range len coins          for j in range price              if i   0                  if  j 1    coins i    0                      twodimensional i j    1                 else                      twodimensional i j    0             else                  if coins i  > j   1                      twodimensional i j    twodimensional i 1 j                      continue                 if j   1   coins i    0                      twodimensional i j    1   twodimensional i 1 j                      continue                 if j   1   coins i  > 0                      twodimensional i j    twodimensional i 1 j    twodimensional i j coins i      print twodimensional  coins    2 3 5 10  domatrix mince2 15

i think so when you are applying the nested loop it will throw an exception because of the reason the index  1  would never exist  20 57

i think for dynamic programming best video lecture available in youtube is     am list pl z 8caslpwekqhdcpmfohnchwz8ty2go  only con is video is in hindi i have followed all the video and he explains the underlying concept behind the problem instead of just saying the solution like jenny lectures 
 kushagraagarwal3297 i think we can just check for i 0   if w is a multiple of coins i    then a i j    1
mam for i   0 a i 1  raise error

how does she make such expressions on camera like there are no real students but she is behaving like she is explaining it to a real person and taking them along with her  she should seriously think starting career in bollywood serials or movies 
god you are an assistant professor he old r you  you look like in the 20s 
wonderfully explained  jenny 
i see many videos but in this video i learn making change at the first time thanks lot
thanks it was excellent mam  
madam i have a doubt when we are writing this statement for i 0 i<coins length i  for j 0 j<w j  if coins i >j  a i j a i 1 j  then from where the first row will get the value because there is no  1 th row   it may take garbage value 
 include  int main void    	int n i   	printf enter no of coins  	scanf d n  	int coins n  	for i 0 i<n i  	scanf d coins i  	int amount scanf d amount  	int j a n amount 1  	for j 0 j<n j  	  		a j 0 1  	  	for i 0 i< amount i  	  		if i coins 0 0  		a 0 i 1  		else 		a 0 i 0  	  	printf n  	for i 1 i<n i  	  		for j 1 j< amount j  		  			if coins i >j  			a i j a i 1 j  			else 			  				 				a i j a i 1 j a i j coins i  			  		  	  	for i 0 i<n i  	  		for j 0 j< amount j  		  		 printf d  a i j  		  		printf n  	  	printf d a n 1 amount  	 	  
 ravitejanalam thanks for your code   
awesome explanation  thanks a lot 
if coins i >j  a i j    a i 1 j    but what when i is 0 nd coins i >j  
we can also implement this logic  using 1d array
can you write code for it 
i think by just over writing the values
in last you explain code but what is the final answer 
its example is for short amount as 15  but the amount is high like 100 200 then what  it is not a suitable method then how we can find the answer in a short way 
the method madam told works for all cases  it depends on whether your own way of code is having correct logic or not 
hello madam  for amount  11 coins available is  1 5 6 8  we are not getting an optimal solution using the method explained by you  can you please elaborate
there are 6 ways to get this total and we are getting 6 using same approach 
you may be missing the case 1 5 5
beauty with brains  o
great  explain very well 
 please make any corrections if required in the below code  coin change problem number of ways to get total   dynamic programming  include  using namespace std  int main   int coins 2 4 6 7   int coin size sizeof coins sizeof coins 0   int amount 20   int table coin size amount 1   int i j   for i 0 i<coin size i   calculating for 1st column alone   table i 0 1      i 0   for j 1 j< amount j   calculating for 1st row alone   if coins i >j      table i j 0      else       if j coins 0       table i coins i 1       else      table i j table i j coins i            for i 1 i<coin size i     for j 1 j< amount j      if coins i >j       table i j table i 1 j          else      table i j table i 1 j table i j coins i               for i 0 i<coin size i   printing the table      for j 0 j< amount j        cout<<table i j <<          cout<<endl      cout<<table coin size 1 amount   total number of ways     
plz madam upload more dp questions
please make more videos on algorithms especially dynamic programming  good explanation thanks a lot
why should we take the values for a particular column from the above row 
because if coin value is greater than weight then obviously we cannot include that coin so we check without including that coin in how many ways we can get that total from above coins  that we have  and that value we have already calculated and stored in above cell so we can reuse it and that is the beauty of dynamic programming  hope you got my point   
 jennyslecturescsit yep got it 
mam please try to make shorter videos 10 15 min with emphasis on just main points
extraordinary explanation mam  thanks how to compute values for a 0 j  when i 0 iteration programatically 
finally i found a grt vedio with some good explanation  
superb explanation   thanks a lot  
please make on some advance dp problem also you are awesome loved the way you explain
at 16 18 for coin 5 and weight 6 there are 2 0 possible ways to get 6  it is written 3  even logically 2 2 2 and 3 3 are the two possible ways no third way to get 6 using coins of 2 3 and 5 
yes it would be 2 by mistake i wrote 3  just follow the formula and you will get 2 by the way thanks for this correction
 jennyslecturescsit  yes i was solving along so stumbled on that difference  thanks for the videos  helped a lot 
excellent loved it
thank you mam amazing explanation 
mam pls make videos on dbms
i wish hamare yaha itni achi teacher hoti  you are great
can we use the top down approach  recursion   memoization  to solve this problem  are there situations where we will choose one dp approach and not the other  thanks
muje ye topic smj ni aaya lekin mam aap bhot cute ho    
 dyan mam pr h isliye nhi aya mujhe toh a gya
 technicalspider2547     
nice and in depth explanation madam and if possible then please make a video on  top down and bottom up approach    
she already has one  here you go   
 finn jp6pn thanks  
great    
  very nicely explained  please make videos on backtracking 
vry nyc superb teacher 
faculty taught in class i was total hogwash  study books  notes did not get anything  search on youtube i got tired  at last i got this video of this lady just iconoclastic such lucid illustration is rare  thanks a lot ma m
iconoclastic 
mam can you check at weight 10 and coin domination 6 
perfect explanation but one thing missed here if suppose we do not have 1 rs  coin means if i have coins   4  10  25  and amt  41 how to calculate this matrix there should always be one row with 0 coin which can have max infinity solns for each amount except 0 which would have 0 solns only  i think that is should include in this video just my advice   
 49sandeep  yes actually i also checked that but instead of initialising the whole 2d matrix with 0 you can try initialising with int max  and when you will find min int max   x  you will get the correct answer  
y 
mam array name is  a  or  coins   
but when the value becomes 50 then the process and table becomes lenghty naa 
if coin is given 2 3 5 6 and amount is 10   then   how i fill the 2d box 
small correction  7 27 the time complexity for solving through recursive approach is not 2 n  but rather 4 n for the taken example  in general  if we have m elements and we need to find for the amount which is taken as n  then we will have the time complexity as n m  where n is the branching factor
jenny  do you have any notes for all algorithms 
amazing explaination mam   
i got logic for getting min no of coins but did not got while choosing the coins  you have chosen only 5 5 why not 9 1
you are awesome  crystal clear explanation

how can you choose 2 coins when you have opted the 6 denomination you shall be using 6 1   4  1 which is equal to 5 coins  kindly revert back if possible 
mem ye side me jo aapne equations vo bhi paper mai likh ne hai ya phir table se sirf find karna hai  
mam 6 rs coin m amount 10 m value 2 kese aayi h mere according value 4 aa rhi h please help  
thanks a lot for the video madam 
thanks a lot for the table  finally understood something  what was happening 
what if there is no 1 rupee coin and instead it starts with 2 rupee coin   then how could we solve this problem 
why i purchase course  this is pure gold content yrr 
did  any one say to you   you are the best
master piece mam you are
this code will throw the array index out of bounds exception   when i 0 and if case will execute 
excellent explanation  i wish though that you would have coded out all the other approaches as well  like regular recursive  top down  iterative among others

i greatly appreciate the video  thank you  however  anyone who writes up the pseudo code on the board will quickly learn that it does not work  here is my solution in java   this is space non optimized  you will want to set the first row proper  then it should work for you   private static int mincoinsnotspaceoptimized int  coins  int amount          int  dp   new int coins length amount   1   set this based on the first coin amount  since it is one then you can increment by one  otherwise you will need increment by the coin value  hope that makes sense           for  int i   0  i < amount   1  i               dp 0 i    i                     for  int i   1  i < coins length  i                for  int j   1  j <  amount  j                    if coins i  <  j                        dp i j    math min dp i   1 j  dp i j   coins i    1                                    else                       dp i j    dp i  1 j                                                           return dp coins length   1 amount       
can anyone give me code snippet for this problem in python
just want to ask  for coin 6 the last column 10 should not the ans be  5  instead of  2 
thank you so much ma m
you are amazing 
thank you  
did you cover matrix chaining in this playlist 
thank you madam  you have explained it so simply and easily 
last wal column hi bharle mam
thanks alot for this wonderful explanation
thanks

w 8   coins   1 4 6 and ans is 2 but your method in this not working
hi mam how much money do you make  in youtube
but how do we fill the each a 0 j  that is the first row not column  actually  
no need to have a 2d matrix   build up your min lookup list   so at target 8 you check all coins <  8 and pull their min values out of the lookup list   so  target 8   check 5 by looking at the value for  8 5  3 in your  min lookup list  then add that count  1 at   min lookup list 5  min min lookup list 3 1 min lookup list 5 
i have a problem and i do not understand  how can i do it  modify the dpchange algorithm to not only return the smallest number of coins  but also to return the correct combination of coins 
learning dsa is a side thing in these videos
excellent explanation
i love you
madam can you explan minimum number of coin for n 10  s 2  5  3  6 
to get amount as ten we can use 1 and 9 coins rather than 5 and 5 how can we get all possible combinations of min coins  
great video  i have a question  why do we copy from the above cell  if the coin value is greater than the sum  to get to the sum of 1  how can we use use 1 no of 5 coin  or to get sum of 2  how can we use 2 no of 5 coins  cannot make sense of that 
she cute
i think this logic will fail for some numbers  34 for an example 
when coin i  > w  why do we copy from the above cell 
thank you

itta achhe se samajh ni aaya ye topic
amazing explanation   thank you 
1 case missing for it
you probably already know this  but if you don t start out with a 1 cent   rupee coin then your algorithm will fail   it needs some additional logic   your tutorials are still awesome and have taught me a lot 
yah  you got stuck at same can you please give me that additional logic 
hey i got that logic  let us take the initial coin as 2 instead  you place 1 if the  weigh w  is divisible by 2  else place that cell with  integer max value   maximum int value  rest of the logic for further rows remains the same  since in each step we always go with the min  value  it will not impact our ultimate result   i will share my sample code if you still cannot get my point   
  srikrishnabejawada3126yes please
although it is hard for me to understand the english accent but still useful and clear with illusion  thanks 
madam it was grt lecture understood everypoint  one question like in the arrays of coins you took  1 5 6 9  and sum is 10  so we were able to fill up the 1st row with the multiple of 1 s r8t as we can make that much sum with the 1st element in the given array that is 1 s   now let say the coin array in  4 5 6 9  and sum is 10  how will be able to fill up the 1st row  i tried myself but i was facing problem on filling up the whole table i am not able to fill up the some section as some no s even if i add will not make 10 hope anyone reading this chat understood what i am saying  correct me if i am missing somthing or if you not able to understand  comment here we will chat and let others know too 
your lectures are amazing  thank you  madam 
i think at coin 6 weight 10 it will come 5 instead of 2
why in 0 1 knapsack for remaining capacity we take values of previous row  but here we take the values of same row 
thank you for the videos hoping to get more and  the c  code 
your solution is confined to starting coin of 1 rs  it fails when another coin other that 1 is at i 0 
excellent
can you give me the code plz 
interviewer  from where you have learnt all this   sir  jenny s lectures  
what are the base conditions in this algo so that the output is correct  since we cannot directly arrive at the first row values when we are provided with initial coin value other than 1 
hands down the last explaination video you need for this  i had problems connecting logic on board with logic in code  simple code snippets are super helpfull  like column is j  row is i 
if coins 2 5 7 8  and w 6 then we can not get the correct output instead of 3 we will get 1   please solve my problem mam 
thank you so much for this wonderful lecture 
perfect explanation but one thing missed here if suppose we do not have 1 rs  coin means if i have coins   4  10  25  and amt  41 how to calculate this matrix there should always be one row with 0 coin which can have max infinity solns for each amount except 0 which would have 0 solns only  i think that is should include in this video just my advice   
can you share your code here   i am facing the same problem
explanation is good  but this can be solved using 1d array also 
what happens to the case when you will not get the change from the given coins   coins    5 6 9    amount   13
really informative
nice explanation thanks 
mam plz solve and upload hackwithinfy sample paper of this year
the  6 10  should be having value 5 instead of 2 
no boss  min of previous row 2  1 row 4 4 means 2
 pijushbasak4273 how   explain  please
madam what if the first element is not 1  then how can we initialize the 0th row   j   coin 0

can you provide us source code of this problem
the way i thought problems should be studies from scratch and explained you are doing the same thing when i told my peers that i take almost around 4 hrs to solve a problem via analyzing they said i am wasting time but the thing is without knowing basics it is pure rattafication i am really happy to reach this channel  thanks for making such in depth analysis videos 
so good explanation  i gave up on this problem because there was no proper explanation to this question  i am thankful to have found this video  keep going  
is that the only soln  there are multiple optimal soln for this eg i e   5 5   1 9

how would you solve this question what is the least sum of money that can be made up of an exact number of 5cents pieces or 25 cents pieces 
the theory part is clear bt the code that is wrong 
i think you see already
wow mam  thank you so much  you are better than my professors  also  thank you for drawing the parallels between greedy and recursion approach <3
she is best

why not  9 1 denominations  to make 10 
i want to know how f 0 and f 1 are stored in memory of memo n  in fib series using dynamic programming
great video
1   4   3
it is mind boggling that this video is free  i mean i have paid for lessons on udemy and i got nothing men  was almost giving up until i got here great unparalleled explanation of dynamic programming on you tube  thank a lot madam
will this algo work if you have no coin with value  1  ie smallest coin value is say 2 
it helps me to in my assigenment submission thanks a lot for this video 
more informative lecture good  upload more videos like this
from last  27 min  i am just trying to understand her approach but  not able to understand a single word 
wrong values placed i e 2 instead of 5 bache to noob  hai hame kya hi pata lagega 
the correct code taking all edge cases and creating table is below    public int coinchange int  coins  int amount        int dp    new int coins length 1 amount 1      arrays sort coins             first column of every row     for  int i   0  i < coins length   i            dp i 0    0                     setting this so that this is default max value  we always        want our dp i j  better than this           for  int j   0  j <  amount   j            dp 0 j    amount 1                 for  int i   1  i <  coins length   i            for  int j   1  j <  amount   j                if  coins i 1  > j                   dp i j    dp i 1 j      take the already best value in above row               else                  dp i j    math min dp i 1 j  1   dp i j coins i 1    take the best of above row and using current coin                                   if  dp coins length amount  > amount      it means we cannot find any coin         return  1        else           return dp coins length amount         
thanks a lot  i had stuck at this line   dp 0 j    amount 1 
coins    1 5  6  9  w   11 a    i for i in range 0  w 1  for   in range len coins   change     for i in range 1  len coins 	 	for j in range 0  w   1  		a i j    min a i 1 j  1   a i j  coins i 		  index    1 for i in range len coins 1   1   1 	 	for j in range w   1   1  		if a i index    a i 1 index  			break 		change append coins i   		index   j   coins i  if index < 0 else index   coins i  				 print i change count i  for i in change 
what if we do not have the denomination of 1  how will we initialize in this case 
how can we print the list of coins used in making the change  like in making change of 40 if we have coins 1 2 5 10 20 25  involves two coins of 20
great explaination madam  it help me alot in  robotics and ai   i was searching on internet i hadnot found great explaination then i purchase the course of princeton university in 15 usd   it was completely worst   i was hopeless then suddenly your video come in recommendation  regards
thanks
hi mam  thanks for the video  is there any steps to find max number of coins in this problem
finally 
solution is not completely correct because if minimum coin denomination is  >1   this program fails  we have to use infinity if no solution exist 
are coin values should be in sorted or not 
need not be sorted  since it calculates all combination and takes minimum value 
teachers like you makes our life so much easy  great  
thrkio
mam in the example while using dp we get the solution as  5 5  but another solution can also be  1 9    so how do we get that one  
the solution in the lecture misses edge cases  correct solution in java    public int coinchange int  coins  int amount            int  dp   new int amount 1          arrays fill dp  amount 1          dp 0    0          for  int i   0  i < coins length   i                for  int j   0  j <  amount   j                    if  j >  coins i                        dp j    math min dp j  1   dp j coins i                                                    return dp amount    amount 1    1   dp amount       
it will not coins those who satisfy the condition it is just give the minimum number of coins   i want coins also   how it will happen  
what if there is no coin of denominaton 1 then how you will solve this  
awesome explanation jenny  sheer dedication of yours is commendable while explaining  i do want to know how do we solve these kinds of problems during interviews because it may not feasible always to draw tables and spend time to calculate all that is there easy or better way to perform all that     also the way you write 2 is very cute and also your last smile  
how this solution becomes dynamic programming approach  as solution do not try to implement in overlapping way and intermediate results 
how you fill the first row of the table using the program  theoretically fine understood 
same doubt bro
i got the explanation but how in dp i will conclude which row column i should refer for various dp problems
really nice breakdown of otherwise complex problem
this is the above algorithm code   in python 3 def count w c    c insert 0 0    q 0 for i in range w 1  for j in range len c      for i in range w 1 q 0 i i   for i in range 1 len c      for j in range w 1            if c i  > j q i j q i 1 j        else q i j    min q i 1 j 1 q i j c i    return q i j  if  name main    w 10   coin 1 5 6 9    print count w coin 
i find   more explanatory and to the point 
loved it how you explain recursion first and connect it with dynamic programming  thank you
fabulous explanation  my all concepts are cleared now  thanks again mam for such beautiful explanation 
great video  can someone explain why complexity for recursive solution is 2 n  we have 4 choices to make at every branches  except the ones where some starts getting less  so the complexity should be 4 n
each and every element have only 2 chances  either to include or exclude  so that is why 2 n
i think it should be 4 n also 
mam for i 0 it is not given   please let me know whether the below code fragment is correct or not how i approach to fill the first row for i 0 i<coins length i     for j 0 j<w j    if i 0        a 0 0 1        if j 0 and j coin i 0           a i j 1        else          a i j 0     
that fly is bothering you jenny lol  
would the approach to finding the used coins work always  for e g  where the money m    11 and we have coins 5 and 6 available 
this logic will not work when coins denomination is not sorted like  2  5  10 1 you can check it please 
jenny  your logic is wrong  just go and try it on   your code will fail miserably  so check your logic and try again  the flaw in your logic is that you have considered 1 as your first coin which let us every amount divisible by it  but if you take first coin as 2 and amount as any odd number your code will fail 
madam plz explain how you wrote for table when coin is of 6 and amount is 5  you have written 1 but how is it possible to make 5 with 6 rupee coin 
can anyone share the code for this program
what will be the values  for a 0 j  if we do not have 1 in coin denomination 
insect be like   jenny you are too adorable  i will be in every lecture you teach  with you forever 
 include   int min int a int b        if a<b      return a      else     return b    int main        int a 100 100      int coins 5      coins 1 1      coins 2 5      coins 3 6      coins 4 9      int amt      printf enter the amount      scanf d amt      for int i 0 i< amt i                a 0 i 2147483647            for int i 0 i<5 i                a i 0 0            for int i 1 i<5 i            for int j 0 j< amt j                if coins i >j          a i j a i 1 j          else         a i j min a i 1 j 1 a i j coins i                                         printf d  a 4 amt      return 0    you can customize it  to make it minimal
ty for your efforts
when i 0 then how we will get a i 1    j    
helpful
nice explanation it would be good if you would write the program to print all the combinations of coins to print the amount value
great explanation  but anyone understands the underlying logic behind this table  i feel that the best i can do is to memorize it  but changing the problem statement might be then because a problem 
not cleared this table in rows and columns
what to do when no combination is  giving us any of the sum from 0 to 10 pls tell me in proper explanation  i  think you r very fast and not cleared
so many dought  didnot understand how you solve this table
best explanation for coin change  way better than tushar roy and back to back swe
mam time complexity 4 n ni hona  chahiye instead of 2 n
mam aap kitna kama lete ho  
this is a totally clear concept  i have seen many videos  they have not any idea what r they doing  thanks
is this working for coins    2  3  5  and w   7 
no her logic will only work if coin 0  is divisible by w  for example you have provided this approach will not work 
you can talk in hindi also
madam solution provided by you does not include condition when first coin is not 1  
 jenny s lectures cs it net jrf   jenny   jenny for input coins 5 6 9  the last cell value becomes 1  which is wrong  this solution does not work  if the required sum value cannot be formed by using the last coin  in this eg  if 1 is not available  then 9 cannot be used to form the sum 10  in this case  this solution is giving wrong answer  can you please look into it and provide a response  thanks  mam
a  i   0    0  also a  0     j     j  both are base cases 
more over i< coin length
omg finally understood the logic  your are the best of all the you tube please also make competitive programming video means solving problem from code forces
teachers like you prove that only those who do not have in depth knowledge does not join teaching for comfortable govt job after clearing net or jrf  our education system needs updated teachers like you  madam  in colleges in india  still only theory theory   theory is being taught and students find it tough to crack product based it giants coding round  i wish there are more teachers teaching in colleges like you madam 
if possible  please forward my message to mhrd or higher education system  our teachers are so so badly back dated  teachers must be forced by govt to stay up to date with technology otherwise just theory will not be enough  this is not just for software related branches  for all engineering branches  teachers must update themselves on  regular basis 
mam how to fill the first row   using program  
here she is telling that we can choose 2 coins of 5 denomination to make 10 but if we choose 2 coins of 1 and 9 denomination then also we can make 10 can anyone explain that 
wonderful explanation thanks
at 19 05 in the table for coin of domination 6  and weight 10 value should be 5 in place of 2
ya you are right bro mam did not noticed 
thank you bro i was checking the comments to see if anyone noticed but they were busy praising madam rather than notice something like this 
 dexter 2503 bro  i was doing the same thing 
this algo will fail in the first loop itself  i 0  and inside the loop it will try to execute a i 1 j    a 0 1 0 a 1 0

she already told you that this is not the perfect code  she is just trying to explain you the concept behind the entire problem  for the correct algorithm  all you have to do is just add an additional line in jenny s algorithm which will be    for i   0   i < no of coins   i          a  i     0     0      this is the additional line        for  j  0   j < w  j                       if   coin   i   > j                      a   i     j     a   i 1     j                else                     a  i     j     min   a  i 1    j     1   a   i     j   coin   i                
 20 33  i did not understand how to get which denominations gives the amount part  can you please explain  jenny   or please provide me a link where i can refer this  thanks
give the ans of this question collect the amount of rs8 given the amount is  1 4 6  using dynamic programing
coins given 1 4 6
what if the denomination of 1 does not exist 
why i get runtime error with this code  
 please read  this method is not fully correct  i have done coding with this method and was getting wrong answer the right method is in tushar roy s video    if you do not believe then code and check yourself     here  jenny ma m please verify this i was into the illusion for months that this is the right method before i tested this method 
great video  thanks a lot  can you please use a smaller example for your future videos 
 
way of teching is beautiful
mam the way of teaching of your s is seriously awesome i previously could t understand the solution of coin changing problem but after seeing your explanation it will be a dare to me to forget the solution ever thank you so much mam for your explanation

what will happen if we do not take one rupee coin then how we will fill our first row and which algo we will use to fill 
if there is no 1 rupee denomination how you are going to take the first row values  plz let me know
nice way of teaching  thanks for this video
nicely explained thanks a lot 
hey  friends  can anyone give the source code of this algorithm  my code is here but it does not work   include  using namespace std  int a 100 100 coin 100  int main        int c      cout<< how many coins do you need <<endl      cin>>c      cout<< coin s are         for int i 0 i<c i                cin>>coin i             int w      cout<< which coin do you want to make <<endl      cin>>w       int len sizeof coin sizeof coin 0      for int i 0 i<len i                for int j 0 j< w j                        a i 0 0              if coin i >j                                a i j a i 1 j                            else                               a i j min a i 1 j 1 a i j coin i                                      cout<< the minimum number of coin to make the certain coin is         cout<<a len 1 w <<endl      return 0   
this is my code i wrote it in java hope it will help you         static int minimumcoin int coins int weight                int num len  coins length          int arr new int num len 1 weight 1          for  int i 0 i<num len 1 i                        arr i 0 0                     for  int i 1 i<num len 1 i                        for  int j 0 j<weight 1 j                                if  coins i 1 >j                                        arr i j arr i 1 j                                    else                                       int min val 1 arr i j coins i 1                       arr i j min val                                                      system out println arr num len weight           return arr num len weight       
if given amount is 21 and number of coins are   2  5  10  20  50   then it fails 
at 24 45 if j < coins i  then we are simply copying the above cell but what about the first row where we do not have any cell above 
for int j 0 j< w j                if coins 0 >j              arr 0 j 0          else if j coins 0 0              arr 0 j 1 arr 0 j coins 0       
your solutions are very clear and precise  keep making them  helped me a lot  will probably help a lot of other students too 
nice explanation  touched the main logic rather than keep on talking about  formula  also finally you talked about how to get those denominations also which is missing in other guys videos   expecting more   like this thanks 
hi here we got the count of minimum change but what the logic for finding the coins values counting up to minimum change
awesome explanation  thank you so much 
cannot get my mind away from you beautiful during the lecture  lecture is beautiful as well 
hi jenny  thanks for the video  at 14 46 when you are referring to above cell there might be a chance we can go array out of index if i 0  are you using 1 array for coins and 1 array for amount or you are using 2d array 
absolutely it will throw arrayindexoutofboundsexception on the very first loop when i 0 because in if block there is a i 1 j 
 sanjaygodiya4443 is not the condition wrong   if we have coins with value less than j sum  then we will not be able to use them   right  
well explained  thank you
awesome
what if coin denominations are 5  6   and 9 what will be the entry 5 6 since it does not has any solution 
can you show us a way of how to transform this into a 1d array  since that will save space and the program will run much faster 
you have really long fingers  do not you 
real answer comes at 11 06
6 59 why cannot you choose all choices   can you help explain that 
 
 maidul13 because  you can only choose coins that are below the amount  eg  if you want to get amount 5  there is no point in choosing 10rs coin or coin greater than 5  
for a larger sum this  need optimization specially for time complexity
just to add space complexity as well 
madam i want to ask when the amount is 10 and the coin is 5 why is not 2 but 1  2 because i think we need 2 coin of 5 to become 10 
sometimes your algorithm shows arrayoutofbound exception  so can you please show us the glimpse of whole code in the last of vedios so we can take the screenshot of the code
at 27 20   instead of two fives  we can also use two coins viz  1  and  9  in which  case how would this alternative be traced from the generated table  
the alternative  9 1  is being traced on the last row  when calculating the number  10  for the coin 9
i love you  jenny   finally a clear and lucid lecture on the subject 
thanks jenny mam for sharing this lecture
what if our coin array starts from value greater than 1  like this algorithm runs fine for  1 5 6 9  but what about for  5 6 9  how to fill first row 
yes  that is my question too  this one works only where array value starts with 1  otherwise we have to put in some more code to make that work 
condition  if c 0 j 0  then a 0 j 1 else a 0 j 0
 sheikabdullasha6476 nope  for coin 5 and w 10 you would put 1  but you need 2 coins  it should be a 0 j    floor j c 0  no need for an if else  setting alwais c i 0    0 of course
 javi5296 thanks dude but your solution does not work if w   3 and coins    2 
too good thank you
madam your video  on this particular algorithm become constitutive for me  
madam there is something wrong in calculation we can make 6 by using two ways but you write 3 ways possible ways are  2 2 2  and 3 3 
jenny   you really made me learn the knapsack and cleary explained issue with recursion and greedy algorthin for such requirement
you are just awesome mam thnq so much  
mam   how to fill 1st row in the example with amount 41 and coins 4 10 25 
hi mam thanks for the video but there are a couple of things that i need to clarify the example that you have shown above does not have any repeated denominations and that is why i guess it worked perfectly when you take the below example where denominations are  4 10 25  and the total amount is 41 so the answer is  25 4 4 4 4 but when we apply the above procedure to this example i do not where we can get the repeated denominations please let me know if this method only works if the lowest denomination is 1 
what will if we do not have denomination of coin 1 
if we do not have coins 1  suppose we have coin 2 3 5 6  and we want to make amount 10  then j value will be 0 10  in this case when j 1  what will be value of a i j   when j 3 or 5 for coin 2   what will be the value of a i j 
please anybody give me full code

thanks jenny  i liked this one  but  for users who may be wondering for some edge case issues like  example  especially when coins do not have a denomination of 1  in your example  you have 1  so it will not because issues  what is the issue in that case  even if that coin is not able to make any number  then also 1 will be written  because of  1 a i j coins i  solution   if  coins i  > j            a i j    i > 0   a i   1 j    infinity     code  const resultarray         for  let i   0  i < coins length  i            resultarray i    new array          for  let j   0  j <  total  j                if  j   0                    resultarray i j    0                  continue                            if  coins i  > j                    resultarray i j    i > 0   resultarray i   1 j    infinity                else                   resultarray i j    math min                       i > 0   resultarray i   1 j    infinity                      1   resultarray i j   coins i

this is not correct algorithm  it will fail for input  2 5 3 6  and sum 11  please rectify your mistake before others follow  your algorithm  above is optimal solution with two dimensional array  it can be done in single dimensional array as well
this is not the correct algo  like if you have coins 3 5 6  then you will get garbage value in first row up to 2  column because there is not a i 1 j  value 
make a row for zero value coin and fill it with some maximum value like  w 1 she has already said this is not exact solution 
great way of teaching and explanation is super cool   you are beauty with brain  and one more thing please try to make videos on competitive programming as well  and try to make things clear by solving problems of  different type    thank you 
faculty taught in class i was total hogwash  study books  notes did not get anything  search on youtube i got tired  at last i got this video of this lady just iconoclastic such lucid illustration is rare  thanks a lot ma m
iconoclastic 
mam can you check at weight 10 and coin domination 6 
perfect explanation but one thing missed here if suppose we do not have 1 rs  coin means if i have coins   4  10  25  and amt  41 how to calculate this matrix there should always be one row with 0 coin which can have max infinity solns for each amount except 0 which would have 0 solns only  i think that is should include in this video just my advice   
 49sandeep  yes actually i also checked that but instead of initialising the whole 2d matrix with 0 you can try initialising with int max  and when you will find min int max   x  you will get the correct answer  
y 
you have taken example according to your simplicity what you put in dp i j  where there is no possible combination  exist  for eg  2 3 5 10 
that is exactly my doubt
 hey prernaaaa  shashikant punia   please refer this solution for case when no possible combination is there  you will get  1   public int coinchange int  coins  int amount            int  dp   new int amount 1          arrays fill dp  amount 1          dp 0    0          for  int i   0  i < coins length   i                for  int j   0  j <  amount   j                    if  j >  coins i                        dp j    math min dp j  1   dp j coins i                                                    return dp amount    amount 1    1   dp amount       
madam   your way of teaching concepts is as beautiful as you  excellent way of teaching  i was hoping more videos on dynamic programming and greedy algorithms  mostly shortest path algorithms and graph theory related algorithms
there are two cases of choosing two coins  first is  5 5  and another is  9 1  to make sum 10  right 
but  5 5  is optimal solution as it uses dynamic programming   whereas  if we use greedy technique   9 1  is correct answer 
intro is damn good and to the point  respect 
aapki writing bhut achchi hai
this solution does not work with 3 5 6 9 when sum is  11
even being from top a nit  you are better than my teachers  thank you  
best explanation ever
 25 00 it should be i<coin length  not i<  coin length
yes  thanks for the correction    
what to do when no combination is  giving us any of the sum from 0 to 10  example if we take set  2 3 5  and we want to have a sum of 10  in this case how to make the table  when will be at j 3 we will fill 0 for i   2 and since it is zero  minimum  we have to copy it for i  3 but by using 1 coin of 3 we can have 3 as sum  so what to do  if any 0 comes we have to copy it to whole column under it 
also  you are not posting optimum solution with regards to space and time complexity 
you missed how to detect when there is no result 
mam you look similar like sherly setia  
i like you as a sis when you r tellng at terminl bye bye nd you are smile is superbb that tym  rely i like you as a sis  
nice methology
thank you dear  mam  
you are really very good teacher of data structure    algorithms  i learn very soon from your explanations  thanks a lot madam  for your without paid teaching  may god bless you  
nice explanation mam

you are the best  jenny 
i do not know why i do not like your bloody hell face  you just do acting and nothing
amazing teacher  wow
oh   jenny 
shouldm t the matrix be symmetric madam  
in our clg the lectures have this much beautiful even our boys did not miss one class also  
 
thank you so much mam
please give c code for this logic mam please mam 
thanks mam
thanks mam 
thanks so much
thankyou  
by which method we have to solve in xam mam by brute force or formula
     
eeeiuu
you are soo sweet mam    you are my love can you marry me 
i came to learn optimization and ended up falling in love with the beautiful lady  
thank you so much madam all concept clear i watched your 0 1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming it is very helpful thank you madam    i shared this with my friends too   
helped me a lot thank you
pupil in 2023 
i came here with full enthusiasm to study tsp because red black trees was not interesting enough   tomorrow s my exam   and jayanti begins with such a soft voice    
upload branch and bound method also
can we choose any one method or two methods  
 jenny  is this c matric standard or we can use any numbers within this matrix  like how come 16  11 6 are the numeric values for b c d respectively 
wah yr kamal ker diya apne tu  mujhy samajh aa gya  
thank you 
nice super excellent motivated
thank you jenny

how time complexity is order of n to the power n
your a cuti  
mam your so cute mam
i watched this vedio before my exam and got full marks  thank you so much madam
sometimes when people first hear about the traveling salesman problem  they think   oh  that is not hard  start with a city on the map  move to the nearest unvisited city  and then on each subsequent step  move to the nearest still unvisited city  until you are done  this strategy is called a  greedy strategy  it always goes to the nearest allowed step   now consider four cities  all placed along the number line  city a is at point 0  city b at point 2  city c at point 3  and city d at point 10     a          b   c                                    d  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10   now  start a traveling salesman tour at city b  and use the greedy algorithm to choose your tour of the four cities  beginning and ending at b  how long is the greedy algorithm s tour                               can you answer me  mam
aaapki awaaj me suru me itni sehmi sehmi se thi aur last me boom boom you are sweet so       thanks
best class mam where we never disappointed         
subha subha aapka face dekha hai paper accha jaan chahiye brna soch lio dislike kr dunga  
mam aap din me kitni baar pelwati ho aur kitne price me  
are mam  the graph is showing two values for each pair  for eg  a b has weight 8 and 16  this is making it confusing   
many many thank you mam  excellent your explain travelling sales man problem  
mind blowing explainition
beauty    
    
very clear
thank you soo much it help me ah lot
thank you jenny
looking soooo cute mam fan of you are face glow

ap smjhte acha h lakin har video ma soti we lagti h  
the tabular bottom up dp approach runs in o n    2   time this recursive approach runs in o n  time but with memoization  saving already computed g start node  nodes set  and re using  it becomes top down dp approach  so  as per the rule  should also run in o n    2   time but i donno how to prove that recursion   memoization algo runs in dp time  if any one knows  please reply  thanks 
      
mam plz explain multistage graph in dynamic programming
mam app kitne cute ho  sab samaj agaya vaise thanks 
really exllent teaching mam
in detail explanation  hats off to you
mam aapse padke to pkka pass ho jaunga daa me
trash lecture   could not understand what the hell you were sayin  also try to reduce the contrast of the video
mam can you make traveling salesman problem by branch n bound technique
thank you mam    
y mam  so tired take rest
why is a to b and b to a not similar 
it can be different  like going by cycle   and coming by bike  
tnxx mam
life saver mam tqq soooo much
will you explain this problem with different example  ie  more than 6 nodes  i am fed up with this common example
  from 2022
this is not dynamic programming 
great  
splendid explanation    thank you so much for the video 
is not this essentially brute force only  you essentially analyzed all possible paths 
 
mam how to cost matrix
thnkxx madam
  kal mst hai mera aaj iss video ko dekhne k baad lag raha hai ye sab easy hai
it is just a recursive approach   there is no dynamic programming in it
very clear explanation mam  thank you
where is the dynamic programming part of this solution  did you store any previous calculated value 
there is no such case for storing and reusing bro  it is just a recursive approach
 ddjampani5480 this video title is  dynamic programming 
mathematics makes a simple problem so complicated
at 24 26 what you heard it is six or replace e to i in six    
pls upload program for this
got exactly what i was looking for  thanks
your voice so less madam
awesome and intuitive explanation that beats all the others i found on youtube for this topic  thanks so much 
english thoda km use kro
thanks for the nice video madam   i had been struggling with graph theory for a long time   but you explained as easily as teachers used to explain in middle school 
thank you 
mam pls put code as well plssss
excellent teacher and teaching style    
explained beautifully  thank you   
  
seeing this before my seminar now i feel confident  thanks a lot mam  
aaya hai bhai  dil vala emoji  kya baat ha bhai
is this really dp  more like bruce force
i most like and arciate you  
how can we implement this within a real world scenario 
mam how you easily can tell the time complexity  is there any way to measure time complexity without calculation 
pseudo code plz madam complete algorithm 
   great lecture easy to learn
is not this method brute force 
hello mam  can you pls give the link for travelling salesman problem using brute force method and using branch and bound  i am not finding 
madam you are in india ya
very helpful  thank you 
you are really very good teacher of data structure    algorithms  i learn very soon from your explanations  thanks a lot madam  for your without paid teaching  may god bless you  
mam if any cost is negative then what we have to do
this is again the easiest to understand video i found  thank you jenny 
i did not skip the ads because you have really taught me 
thanks
i love you
tharki
mam one doubts in all lecture   mai note banata hu serial by serial  isiliye  topic ke saath defination  ko vi boad pe likhiye mam please revision me problem ho jata hai 
awesome
plz make videos on service to product based company switch video on graph theory bit manipulation
madam exam me branch and bound method aata h
if only my teacher explained to me this clearly in class i would be somewhere now  thanks madam for breaking down a complex problem so intuitively
mam   in previous coin problem video for finding maximum number of ways     you told there is 1 way to get the amount 0   but in this video   you are telling there are 0 ways to get the amount 0   can you explain me this clearly mam
you are pretty 
can somebody paste the code here if they have done the exact implementation 
thank  you so much mam for solving this problem
thank you so much mam
bahut pyaari ho mam aap 
really  i appreciate this lecture video incase of its more understandable  10q jenny s am with you when ever i am in cs 
you r beauty with brain       
i am chartered accountant  similar concept is available in costing paper  which we will call it assignment problem
i was kind of stressed out but your smile in the begging made my day  and by the way great explaination 
to unka exam nhi hai  vo to smile krengi hi  hmara exam hai  hm royenge
thank you madam
plz upload a backward approach and forward approach  from bharuch gujarat
very good explain but automatic text  not showing vedio  proper
honestly  i do not think you are approaching this the right way at all  keep in mind simplicity and speed in my solutions   look another way  given vertices  we need to find the most  circular  shape  a circle is perfect solution to tsp   take a loop around your nodes  then contract it  until every node is connected  one way to do this   just take any two nodes  and connect them  back and forth  because we need to return  to form an initial loop  then keep adding nodes one by one whichever adds the least amount to a total distance for connecting it  this gives like just some 6 8  worse solution from expected perfect  for 1500 nodes  another way to do this is  instead of loss of distances  let us include points by their angle to the nearest line  take a loop around our nodes  join all the outside vertices  to make a convex polygon  then add any other vertex making a 180  because these are alreadty on our way anyway  and the closer the angle to 180  we give it priority to include  this produces just about 4  longer solution to anything we know for 1500 nodes  now combine the two  and the actual solution is probably to make a convex outside polygon to include all points in it is area  then find the centroid  then take the most distant points  include  then include all the  outside   outside of the new polygon after including the point  points  repeat  basically like putting pins  then using your fingers to get the thread around the pins towards the center  including every vertex on the way with least amount of tension possible  this way we use the least amount of thread possible 
also to people who theorize multiple dimensions  we could probably just put every vertex in it is own  dimension  and then shrink it into 2d  should also do the job  edit  i am not good in math  ussr uni did not like me for not bringing sweets  d
25 02 you have erased plus sign   
i have one doubt   why is dynamic programming named here there is no repetitive processing done in this approach   this is a simple recursion problem   plx explain an thankyou for explaining    
slam mam  mam kindly tell us that how can we write the algo for travelling salesman problem  also
my teacher posted this link in our google classroom  
same for me i do not know why we are paying them i am doing my engineering through online material and yt
same here
everything  google     
 anirudhakulkarni9134 you are paying them to take exams  lol
      
three teachers on you tube with data structures and algorithm videos   only one female  good to see women in computer science
   
 anirudhakulkarni9134 you are paying for degree 
  
where you are studying
 anirudhakulkarni9134 yes  
google  yt  se padho google k bare me padho and isk bad usi k liye job bhi karo google has a system life cycle for employment     google me job kne valo ko google ne hi padhaya hai   
  
   
 haadbajwa7565 who are the other two 
 anirudhakulkarni9134 mee also included   i believe that we peoples are worth for engineering because we just learn by ourselves with our own material and own notes  own searching of best lectures in you tube i just feel proud iam right my engineer fellows    
our ds sir also provides jenny mam link  
tomorrow is my exam you are saviour to me
thank you teacher 
this method is awesome compare to coloum and row reduction method  anyways thanks mam 
mam how to solve 5 nodes traveling salesman problem with some infinite values  that means no edges between some random nodes 0    6     7   8    9 4    0     3   6    7 7    8     0   5    4 5    6     7   0    in 12  in   in  11  0
i understand basics from your channel 
do the same problem with branch and bound method
mam  please make a video on the branch and bound
spr teaching 
madam plz upload the code  if this code is already uploaded in the membership than tell me  i will take the membership 
happy teacher s day
so beautiful          
thank you so much mam  such a good explanation   
all good but should be better prepared before recording
i have been watch tutorials for years and thankfully i found a helpful channel  keep up with good work 
mam  how is this a dp problem   i mean that was just a recursion thing in which you took decision tree to give a understanding of the problem   you did not used any top or bottom approach  
dp should be removed from the video title 
yes  same doubt  
 jenny s lectures cs it net jrf you should do a video on the proof of the complexity for this method 
mam could you please suggest me from where you have read and understood the concepts  you are damn well explaining and i want to learn this subject more deeply so suggest me a website or books or the best place you know so that it increases my conceptual and coding skills in dsa
great mam
only vedio only which explain the formula thank you madam   
the best teacher ever   give like if you also like the way madam teaches 
good explanation 
thanks mam you are the best teacher in the world  please ap hamay thoday or questions kraya kro taki hamari gate ki preparation ho jaye            
love you    and your teaching skills
why so worried     make smile on face
thankyou mam

jenny madam we love you
after watching your tutorials a lot i got something very clear  you explain things more beautifully than abdul bari  he teaches well also  your tutorials look similar to him  but you are good at explaining  and thanks   lots of love from balochistan
that problem is in dynamic  what we do when problem is in branch and bound
march 1 and blue dress at diwali and sunrise cannot wait   
abdul bari ke pas jao

baaki sb toh theek h   aap ro kyo rhe ho  
excellent work mam god bless you
madam ap sexy lag rhi hai
tumhari mummy sexy hai  she is a teacher respect her
mam this video also has relative content loudness of  3 5db  many of us are watching you on mobiles and laptops without earphones  please give some efforts on good video editing and processing too  thanks 
bakki pdhana to jabardast hai
mam starting me appke awaaz ko kya ho jata hai bohot irrating lgta hai
you are too cute 
osom  i am cs from past 5 year   i think you are way of teaching just osom how simply you explain in  you are videos i to like you are quick sort vidoe too much keep it up 
great work madam
please explain the time complexity in detail
class ko jao bey
hello madam could you please make some video tutorials on dynamic programming and how to solve real life problems using dynamic programing with some hands on coding or by using algorithm with clear explanation of the methods used in the algorithm
i have uploaded some videos on dynamic programming  but i m still working on some more dp problems  will upload soon   
hello madam according to the tree you represented there are few methods like g c  d  has been used twice to calculate the result in each recursive call  so can we just hold the first result and apply this during its second call to decrease time complexity or we are recalculating the methods over and over  and what approach is this whether top to down or bottom up approach
yes  exactly you should do it  as it saves computational cost with respect to recursive calls   that is the primary difference with recursive approach and dp 
nicely explained
could this be solved via dijkstra algorithm   because it resembles like that 
dijkstra algorithm     had to learn it in my matlab in my masters to solve a transportation problem using dijkstra algorithm   what beautiful memories    
madam jii please implement krke v samjha dijiye c  me bohot shukrgujar rhunga

you rock jenny lamba  you made this problem so easy  amazing explanation by a very attractive lady  keep it up 
you are really so cute    your methodology of teaching is like a friend    keep it up    
rajat mittal   please subscribe my channel
please upload  the johnson s algorithm lecture also 
sure  will try to upload as soon as possible 
vaibhav tum bhi inhi se padh rahe ho beta
i want to give you one suggestion please give link of code also so that students can also visit it understand how to write program for given algorithm  which will really helpful  
good work jenny   hope soon your subscribers or views will be in millions  
loved the way
explanation is too good i think matrix values is not similar eg  w a b 16 hence w b a  should be 16 right 
rajesh gowda it is not always true that weight should be similar  in a graph cost of  a b  and  b a  can be different   its just an example 
no it is not always true  weight of edges will be given in question i have taken just an example 
your explanation is the best compared to 3 other higher quality teachers i watched on 0 1 knapsack problems 
  ay9523 his explanation with solving seems difficult came to jenny mam understand successfully
same
true
end of the video session is not that clear to understand mam
tq mam
mam mere ko to aap se pyaaar hoo gay hai  love you mam
please solve the following question  weights    10  5  5  profits    25  35  45  and the given capacity of the bag w    15
nice explanation
thank you so much   great explanation 
you are extremely different beauty full   teacher
thank you 
great explanation mam  and clear understanding is there in you are teaching 
best explanation on this topic
the final answer will be 1010 please check it once
yes you are correct  i also got the same
mam you should add brackets over there m i  w max m i 1  w m i 1  w w i pi                                                               
jenny mam happy valentines day    and i love you   
you have a knapsack with a maximum capacity of 5  there are 4 items with their respective weights and values  item 1  weight 2  value  12 item 2  weight 1  value  10 item 3  weight 3  value  20 item 4  weight 2  value  15 for this if we sort the weights in increasing order  we will get 35 on the last cell 4 5 which should be the maximum  but in cell 3 5 we get 37 meaning the value in the last cell is not the highest  therefore we cannot change the order in which the elements are given  please check once madam  i have checked on my side and come to this conclusion stated above 
 jenny s lectures cs it mam  mai itna paisa kamana chahta hun ki mujhe aap mil jao  wait for 3 years   ek baar graduation hone do  khud rishta aapke ghar launga  people would think i am simp  but this is pure admiration for the work you do  ily
she is already married
video is useful  
thank you mam your explanation is full deeply and your teaching way mind blowing thanks love you mam
12 46 why go to the above cell   anybody pls explain
hlo baby i   you
can we solve the 0 1 kmapsack using tree method 
i am really very happy i got to understand much better thank you so much for sharing such an amzing content 
make it only in english  you are give us bad time with you language
saw 2 other youtube videos and yours is the easiest and best 
mam you are explanation is better in english rather than english   
thank you so much madam  
   mam
nice explaination   but in 11 09  i do not got it
i not understand at 4th item  totally confused 
me too
thank you for the detailed explanation 
thanks  nice explanation  ms  jenny
well explained
if m value is given example then what to do
we do not have to take them in ascending order     madam the answers will not match the answers in book  
what a coincidence   madam you pick the example of laptop as 0 1 knasack and at the same time i also thought  about laptop
1010 should be answer as last one we are not selecting  
your calculations for  3 5   3 6 3 8  cells in that table are wrong  check it once
madam aap ulta likh diye hai  upar 1 6  hai  uski jagha  4 5  likh diya please reply here that set mein order matter ni karta isliye likhe hai kya 
ap hindi bhi use karte ho   pata nahi tha   apke muu mai se english hi suna hai

you write above weight 3465 but below you write 3456
i love you meadam                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
best explanation mam
i lost hope on the exam but this particular video boosted me like anything  thank you 
mam please upload video  job sequence with deadlines
finally understood  
what happens if the weights are in 100s 
jenny  wait for me until i get to google   
i never forget that cute smile while saying till then bye bye   at the end of every video  
madam youa re vary beutiful   i love you                                  
x1     how to find it 
what will happen if wi>w  should i copy the upper cells value or what 
with apology  you should try to keep it simple   this is a simple question  although you made too much complicated 
plz use dark markers  
if the weight is 500kg what is the optimal solution 
mam can we do like this method only or otherwise we want apply for all directly we can do like this no mam for 8marks
i subscribed
your teaching is awesome mam
but solving with another  example with same process we are unable to get the same answer
pls do a vedio for set method in dynamic programming and disk shechudilng algorithms in operating systems  pls mam
madam you told that weights have to be written in ascending order but for gfg if we use the ascending order  the output is wrong but not sorting the weight array gives the right result 
  thank you
aaichi gand lai complicated hot   rav he knapsack pn samajun samajun samjl thod far   by the way thank you mam
wow
thank you so much mam   
as a seller who has only 8kg bag at shop this video is very helpful    
1010 will be the items selected 1st item and 3rd item  correct it mam
guys  how did mam write profit order  2 3 1 4   this is the order but wen mam is solving  mam have written  2 3 4 1  why 4 is before 1 
write the weight in ascending order  forget about profit  just focus on weights which must be sorted in ascending order
nice
nice explaination thank you
wtf is this  i asked for recursion 0 1 knapsack 
mam you are too cute  
please make videos in hindi or try little mixing 
overall your videos are very nice and your way of teaching is amazing   you are my best teacher
aoa mam  your all videos are very amazing  but i want to say one thing to you  kindly must add one thing in your lecture and that thing is to explain that why we study these algorithms  and where these algorithms will help in our daily life
13 50
very good explanation     
waahhhh  
tomorrow is my ese exam you saved me mam  hare krishna   
how profit number  2 3 1 4 change  2 3 4 1
the pi  is nt it suppose to be 1234
one of the worst problems in dsa
your mom is one of the worst  lut in your city
thank you madam lots of love 
thanks mam  
madam really thankx for explain but my question is what if weight is same 
you got a subscriber  
nicely explained
mam how can you be so cute  
dafuq is this how can you have an item weight 6 but the profit is 1 lmaooo this is dumb
gods never helps directly so he sent you 
love from pondicherry university
mam you r so beautiful   i am just focusing on you  love you  madam
thank you soo much mam
the second day researching on how to tabulate this problem and i have found the solution here  well explained     
thank you mam

thank you thank you emcheppagalam inthakanna  there is no machines no formulas to calculate the wait of your knowledge madam your are an absolutely a god made milestone for me  every before day of my exams  you are the one   only hope to me maaam we sending the lots of love from me and my friends for you maaam finally we simply saying with most weighted hearts   just one word we are really thankful to you   maaam  thank you for teaching every concept about data structures java c c what ever you said  you r like the heaven to every pass aspirants from the present b tch students like me   thank you maaaam from ap students 
thank you very much  would you mind telling me if this approach is a top down or bottom up algorithm  you are awesome 
it is bottom up approach
bhai mai skip kar raha ye question exam me
you are better than abdul sir
23 46 i seriously laughed here   its like you are asking  are you with me    
what if the bag weight is large  like a 3 digit number 
hawa sikauxas maile kei bujina 
i  love you mam  you are looking better  than problem
to post the algorithm of 0 1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming
good understand  
beautiful topic by beautiful girl              
kya bol rhi ho      learn it perfectly 
thank you madam 
your way of teaching is awesome madam  
very good explanation mam easy to understand plz give video for job sequencing with deadlines
but how do we rearrange the weight array  if we just sort it   we will lose the  respective values right 
use vector pair sort
you took perfect example for delivering concept it cover every loophole   
bro what is your age i am 20 bca 2year learning dp  does i am late
 anantmouraya8113 no you are not  all the best 
27 14 there is an mistake it is  1 0 1 0   you can cross verify if we are considering the object   1 0 0 1    its exeeds the knapsack capacity 
true i was thinking the same
yes you r right bro
actually 3rd and 4th value was swapped
thanks 
madam hindi mein hi bol do  hindustan me hi rehte ho aur hindi bolne mein sharam aati hai aapko  aap hindustan ki teachers ko hindi  mein padhane mein kya problem hoti hai toh samjh se pare hai mere  par agar aap meri iss winamar request ko samjh le toh mera din ban jayega   aap thoda hindi ke shabado ka ucharan apne video mein kar lijiye taaki bachoon ki achi maddat ho jaaye  baaki rahi baat concept ki toh woh aapse accha koi nahi padata hai  koi bhul chuk hui ho toh maaf kar dijiyega  pranam jenny ji 
guys according to problem and which mam told logic when comparing both at 3rd row 5 6 columns getting different values did you observe  if you get same like then mention me l  thank you 
i can solve this problems and others but to write the code is my problem      
thank you so much madam it helped me a lot will you please share a video on vertex cover problem please  it is very important for my exam  
w 3 5 7 p 3 7 12   mam plz provide solution for this 0 1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming

thank you so much it was the easiest way to do it with more sense  i love you    
mam thanks a lot for making this video  your teaching method as well as experience is very good      
thank you madam
do we have to give a special condition where if w indicating the size of bag    w i the item weight  is a negative value  that means if the bag capacity is less than the size of the current item weight then we just need to put the above row values 
i checked   w  or w o sorting the weights  end result is the same
why should we sort the weights when dp is anyway going to compute max cost for all combinations of weights and knapsack capacities 
watching this on the exam day  
you wrote off some other table
hey jenny did you learn this from abdul bari video     looks almost similar example  anyways good going
 1  0  1  0    the weights  3   5   8  contributing to max profit  2   4   6  not  1  0  0  1 
well the answer is right because the valve of x is already arranged in question and we have to answer the question according to given valve
 nishantshrivastava8937 yes   agree at the time of writing my message  i did not notice that jenny had intentionally sorted the weights   so i took table data as the truth and input as typo  later  i realized it is unnecessary to sort   whether we sort on weights or costs or do not sort   0 1 knapsack gives same result   as it is based on dynamic programming
plz reply why profit has takken 2341 it was given 2314
it is soooo  confusing unable to understand  
please  explain everything in english
this is the best video for this problem   very good video   
amazing explanation  
great  
thank you so much madam  this is the best explanation of 0 1 knapsack problem on youtube  this video cleared all of my doubts  keep posting these videos divyanshu singh
best ever tutorial i  got
achese samjhalo thoda behen 
just awesome teaching 
is this same as knapsack problem by the memory function algorithm 
thank you madam
thanks
i do not understand anything in last part
aditiya verma ne aapki insult ki
really very good teaching skills mam  thankyou so much    
now i get it  thanks
please upload the best quality vedio it is unconfortable for watching for eye sight students
is this and top down approach are same 
mama i love you
thankyou so much mam  the way you explain every point bit by bit in detail is simply brilliant 
sorry akka
          
there is a slight mistake in the value of pi in table written 2 3 4 1 instead of 2 3 1 4 which give incorrect answer in m 3 8  otherwise the video was awesome  thanks  
nope she sait it should be ascending order by weights
after searching many videos i have find the simplest and easiest way    thanks mam  
mam weights are  3  4 6 5  and you have taken 3   4 5 6
can i have the code for that last x  in c programing 
what a great explanation mam  
what if w 40  how can we draw this much large table in exam
we will be able to take all the items then because sum of all item s weight < total capacity 
not satisfactory explanation be sure first yourself
thanks for the video mam  lucid explanation 
last part was not very clear
plz explain in hindi 
if m 105 then how to solve problem
thanks madam
thank you  i could recall the problem implementation with your explanation  small correction if you can consider is the formula given to fill the cells will not work for the cells in initial columns where that row s weight is less than that column s weight  try applying the formula to the cells where we have 0s filled  in that cases  we can copy the values from above rows which ofcourse you have covered in explanation  thank you 
uff this ix complex method you cn divide p w in the start  you make this too complex
is it necessary that the rows should be sorted by object  item  weight or any order of object  item  rows  
nice presentation 
very good lecture
jenny is a jhaantu aurat  she will make you handicap to mug up the things  she don t know the logic she is just a bastard
baaji yeh jo aapny formula use kya hy na wo ser ky uper se guzar gya
it would  be more helpful  if you say how to derive that formula  it s very hard to derive the formula  finally understand on own 
mam we can also take the weight and profit without sorting b w thanks mam
only you have made me explained mam  great respect   everyone is talking shit  either they are making memoization tabel or they are explaining code 
please read my question mam actually you are taking profit values are 2 3 1 4  and when you are solving the problem you taking profit as   pi                               2                               3                               4                                1
thanks for the videos but can you just add the code snippet just like you have been doing in some of your videos   once again thank you very much cos you have broaden my knowledge on  data structure and algorithm implementation   youarethebest
in place 6 it would be 7
love you dear madam
dear mam   with  the method it is easy to solve the problem but if the weight value 17 and n value 5 so it is getting trouble please help me on this its a humble request  i am showing you the proper questions that is  solve following 0 1 knapsack problem where n 5   p1  p2    p5     16 12 2 5 6   w1  w2   w5     7  5 3 2  8  and m   17 
youtube to me   wake up early in the morning and do on thing learn something from this teacher  highlyrecommended    me to youtube   yes sir  
what if the capacity is 40 i e w  40  do we need to make 40 coloums
madam mai padhne aya tha apko hi dekhta reh gya   
here is the full solution including finding the index of items used in the knapsack def knapsackproblem items  capacity         items    1  2   4  3   5  6   6  7        capacity   10      items insert 0   0  0      matrix    0 capacity 1  for i in range len items      for i in range 1  len items          p  w   items i          for j in range 1  capacity   1                j is the weight or capacity of knapsack             if j < w                  matrix i j    matrix i   1 j              elif j   w                  matrix i j    max p  matrix i 1 j              elif j > w                  if i   len items 1 and j   capacity                      print matrix                  matrix i j    max p  matrix i 1 j w  matrix i 1 j      result capacity   matrix i capacity        find items in the knapsack     indices used   list      j   capacity     while i >0          if matrix i j    0              break         if matrix i j    matrix i 1 j              indices used append i 1              j   j   items i 1  	i  1     return  result capacity  indices used 
wow  this explanation is far better than what i see at algoexpert by clement  his is sloppy  i wish jenny could add the explanation for how to getitems in the knapsack  for e g  if the final answer is 10 in your matrix  then you can use that and go up the matrix to find what are the indices of the price and weight arrays that went into the total weight or capacity 10 
by the way  jenny is atleast 15 years younger than me  there were a lot of things i did not learn before i embarked into this profession  these are fundamentals that i get to refresh learn from jenny  thank you teaching these concepts so well   one suggestion for jenny  say fib oh na chi instead of fib oh na ki
answer is 1010 not 1001
explained very well   
i love wen she speak indian in middle english
mam m 2 8  m 6 hona chahiye because maximum profit 6 ho skta h   3 and 5 ka mila k
mam engineering apke hi bharose hi chl rhi h
thank you mam
 
  
imagine having madam jenny and sir  varun singla as teachers at the same university all students will be toppers  
i request to you please explain in hindi
aapne hindi me explain kiya usme maza aa gaya
thank you   
good teachers need to be valued  subscribed  
mam love you and your explaining
good explaination and looking good mam 
she is cute 
pehle pehle thik raha end me magaj ka dahi vadaa ban gaya  
mam please shoot in better quality  
thanks a lot
we are giving fees to colleges   their whatsapp status no teaching fees only   and here madam s status   no fees teaching only  
wow madam  you are best explaining these complex theories in so simpler manner with detailed explanation that gives us in depth knowledge with complete understanding of the concepts 
your explaination and tricks are just awesome  that is why people come to learn these lectures from youtube even though they learn from their universities
clear explanation  thank you mam 
plz improve  video quality
chaava mam kya samjhati ho nice explanation
understanding slowly but it is clearly understood   
hyee   tmhre avaz  
you are teaching very clearly thank you so much
hindhi lo cheppaku jenny vro
thank you so much madam          aapke explanations amrit ki tarah hai  
very useful for people who are appearing for interviews 
thank you very pleasant explanation
i am a mechanical engineer and i know the basics of c  though i am a mechanical engineer your videos are easy to understand and awesome  thank you mam 
 
      thank you
cannot we add same item more than once  
no
your videos are just brilliant 
mam can you please make a vedio on matrix chain multiplication using dynamic programming
i understand the concept but in the end i never get the intution behind these logic its more or less mugging up the process like what we have to do next do not know about the other but if there is another problem same or little bit different from this i need to again check up the solution  by the way thanks mam for explaining the process
i am a seller who has a bag which can contain 10 kg weight so in order to maxmize my profite i am selecting those items in those ratio
follow books for understanding the full proof and the formal algorithm 
she has explained well enough not sure what you cannot understand  for every cell it is a choice between picking that or not picking that and comparing the profits
  scuba485  bro it was a year old comment and explaining the intuition behind the pick and nonpick and how you arrive at it is what i want to know at that time  solving 10 questions on 2d dp anyone can get the process in their head  from a beginner pov arriving at logic is the toughest part and that is the thing i expect in the video that i did not get that is why commented it 
try watching from take you forward  he teaches coding along too
 bhagatalisha thanks for suggestion but it is 1 year old comment i am already placed now   but yeah striver bhaiya is no doubt best when it comes to dp playlist
 deveshdubey6776 greattt congratulations  i did notice it was a yr old comment though   but can be helpful to someone else too
  bhagatalishayeah for me
  bhagatalishaand me
 lenny 7801 glad  
 dastagirwajahat great  
very nicely explained  although i don t think the sorting of the items according to the ascending order of their weights is necessary 
can we solve 0 1 knapsack problem using greedy algorithm 
thank you mam  just impressive
madam profit jb likhengy ascending order me tw 1 2 3 4 hona chahiye tha na yahan apne 2 3 4 1 esy q likha 
thank you madam
thanks your explanation is very clear
i am getting confused while creating the table   can you please solve this problem using the tabular method 0 1 knapsack problem   wi    2 3 5 7 1 4 1  and respective profits are pi    10 5 15 7 6 18 3  using dynamic programming  thanks in advance 
what about a  condition where the weight is much much higher than 8  we cannot make table for such large numbers
understood  thank you madam 
very helpful video   thank you so much 
at 13 40 y do not we select 3 3  so that profit would be 2 2  4  instead of just 4  profit is 3   
you are a great teacher 
mam why we are taking profit values in does not follow order either increasing or decresing
thank you  
mam can you apply m i w  formula on m 2 3 
i have watched several videos on this knapsack problem however i could not understand well until i watch your thoroughly explained video 
please english only
with each topic i understand from you i fall in love with you  cannot help myself sorry madam  3 <3
tom is performing an experiment in which he has to select n products  each product has two attributes i e  energy and weight  all the products are either manufactured by reds ltd  or blues ltd  the products manufactured by blues ltd  cannot function alone and need to be selected with some other product of the same company  the products from reds ltd  on the other hand  can be selected independently  tom has to select products such that the total weight of the selected products does not exceed the weight w and the selected products have the maximum total energy value  write an algorithm to help tom find the maximum energy 
i will not watch your videos any more from now on  because your beauty distract my attention time and again  cannot really focus on learning  instead of taking notes i draw your face on paper  i think it is too much
thank you so much  i watched a lot of videos about this problem  but this is the best  
thank you 
love you    mam
glad that i chose this video to understand the concept  nicely explained 
mam  should the weights be sorted beforehand  as we r taking the values from the previous cell 
mam try to explain the coding part too mam  
love you mam 
thank you  
hands down jenny is the best cs teacher on youtube  watched many videos but only your explaination is going in my head  <3 also you have a very soft and cute voice  
amazing 
thanks
thanks you so much mam for  making this video         
if you do not talk hindi we can all understand better  ty
waah bete wah wah bete moz kardi  tum to bade heavy driver ho
thnx
poor video you have took very simple example that does not come in exams
well explained but you were looking little nervous 
this is the best explanation of 0 1 knapsack problem on the internet  you are the best mam  thank you for working so hard for us 
your explanation is very useful for me thank you  apart from the subject you looking cute and you are voice is sweet
loved your way of teaching <3
is 2 3 4 1 arranged in ascending order   
what if w is very large  like 20 25 
p 11  21 31 33   w 2  11 22 15   c 40 n 4 0 1knapsack problm  mam plz solve q
thank you mam   
thanks  for your help      your way of teaching is excellent 
this is by far the best explanation to the knapsack problem ever  thank you for uploading
superb

not a good approach to teach or learn dynamic programming you should teach 1st the recursive way instead of just drawing the array  like this we can t learn concept and in case of any new problem we cannot solve those 
this explanation cannot be more precise and easy to understand this madam   kudos to you 
thanks you  tomorrow is my exam this helps me alot  
why you should take the values in ascending order  plz tell me mam
excellent effort 
thanks mam assignment solve hu gai  i do not know where you from india or pakistan but respect from humanity 
poor quality video but good quality teaching
question  p 11 21 31 33  w 2 11 22 15  c 40  n 4  i am unable to solve plz help as soon as possible mam 
order of pi no understand 
aap ka jenny nhi genius hona chiye tha badal lo plz  thanks for clearing concept so smoothly 
very clear you make out madam  thnku  
mam   your voice is sooooooo  sweet   i want to learn forever   every time a new thing  
mam i am your big fan  after watching your lectures  thank you so much mam what a explanation amazing mam 
at 21 04  in the formula it should be w w i 1    as array starts with 0 index  when  i   4   w i  gives does not exist at all
no  this is actually correct in all books
wonderfull explanation ever seen       
6 02 what if the total weight given is is 500 or a big number  how to allocate coloumns then 
column to 500 for sure
jenny you are amazing   thank you
go an see knapsack videos of aditya verma  you will feel the difference
could you please tell me why do we start with 0 profit here  we started from one for the coin exchange problem 
damn  you are smile  
mam is it mandatory to take weights in ascending order or not
mam dekhne to problem aaya tha par mem plz plz english sikha do mem plz
what if two weights are same 
can you pls help me to make table of ths problem 0 1 knapsack using dp  values 10 20 30 40 50  weight 23 34 66 20 10  w 100
lol  table for you   with w run  > 0 to 100  just do it like here do not need to sort weight
love from bangladesh
6 33 no  it does not need to be in ascending order 
 i think  it should be in increasing order since we are giving priority of each objects so it is better to write that way 
 abdullahalmasum5542 no  the algorithm works whether it is sorted or not  sorting the linked value is not easy to program 
 sourav9063 you are correct bro  i made a mistake but learn something good  thnx  the answer is here also   
 abdullahalmasum5542  just a suggestion  if you understand the algorithm instead of remembering the steps or formula  it  will be easy to  get why the order is not important      most of the online lectures i found do not do this 
mam plz greedy approach ka b krva dyn question
thank you so much mam for such teaching         
please man teaching in hindi
mam i have a doubt in this place of table i w 2 8  there you have put value 5  it is coming 6 when i am calculating the same way you told plz tell me how  
verry nice   you are   2 n  times better than my teacher 
are you anglo indian 
thank you jenny  this is really helpful
mam  please try to upload videos in hd at least if not possible in fhd 
hello madam   my college professor also watch your video and explain this in college but the problem is she is giving the same example and she have no any skills of explaining i think i waste my time in college but 75  attendance    forced me to join
mam also teach strassens matrix multiplication
nice explanation    
mam do you no how to create programm for online tutor that is class sheduling and managing for mini project   mam even iam ready to pay for it 
your explaination is very nice  but too much advertisement irritates
i do not know this happens with me or every one   the same concept thought by other teachers on youtube is not understanding  but when madam teaching the  concept it is perfectly understood      thank you madam 
i feel the same 
now that is called attention  
jenny mam is awesome

 vipsclassicalboy   
the videos are evergreen
thank you for your hard work by making educational videos  i always recommend my friends to watch your video
mam you are explanation is very clear  it is now easy for me to attend this type of problem  thank you for teaching mam     i am you are student from puducherry mam
i am  trying to focusing but green is more attracting  what should i do 
thank you jenny madam  very nice teaching  
thank you so much mam to explain this topic so much easyly
thank you mam this is the best explanation i have got so far  love you
hope you can publish more video  so helpful and best video 
awesome tutorial  very detailed explanation  a slight correction in p and w at top of table   p 2 3 4 1  and w 2 3 5 6   the values at index 2 and 3 is swapped for both p and w 
correct bro
can you explain this 
thanks  i was implementing here and the matrix was not the same  i was getting mad   
she sait it should be ascending order by weights
she took w in ascending order
that only i was thinking it is 1010 ans
best explainer
madam are you from hyderabad 
is it necessary to write the weights in ascending order  because the result is same for given order of weights 
brilliant lecture  you explained exactly in the same way how 0 1 knapsack algorithm formulated  i am able to relate the complete formula  helped me to avoid my phobia for dp 
those eyes  make sure i can concentrate on the topics goodly you are such a fantabulous teacher  
mam i have fallen for you  
everyone teaches procedure but no one teaches concept that is the problem with our faculty s
madam if you want some help on some topics please tell me
i like you video but looks like sometimes you speak some sort of indian language   but anyway thank you for the good video 
i watched other videos to understand this problem but could not  but you explained  so well   thank you   
selecting items according remaining weight will be a better approach than selecting items according to remaining value edit  ooh later in the video its done using remaining weight nice
what is  lookup table 
you do not know but your awesome teaching skill help me to achieve 6  coder on codechef
we do not need a w 1 n 1 matrix we can solve it using array of w 1 size
thank you so much 
it is amazing thank you
formula is kind of sketchy to remember xd
is it necessary to sort the weight 
thank you so very much jenny      i understood dynamic programming today and i am so happy    
salute mam  
can you upload playlist of computer networks 
such an amazing video explaining the topic  thank you so much  watching it one night before my exam  very helpful 
i am in love  with your teaching
may be there is no need to sort the two given array according to the increasing weight   this kind of dynamic programming works well on unsorted arrays and also sorting will increase the overall complexity 
why we have to sort the weight arr  can we perform without sorting 
good video
amazingly explained  this is so good  all the best 
why was the first wieght taken from index 1  why not from index 0  i guess in coin changing problem  we have started from index 0  can you please explain the reason for it 
the best
you r not following the steps  jumping straight to the tabulations  dp is based on recursion  you should have started with recursion  how can you make the table at first without knowing the initial conditions 
madam you just saved my day  tomorrow is my exam 
same here  
kottaya sappu
thanks madam  very well explained  
if total weight is 20 than
make videos on backtracking algorithm and branch and bound technique  jenny
thank you very much madam i always had a lot of doubts and afraid of doing knapsack problems now i am very happy and able to solve many problems on this model 
her lectures go from 0 to 100 in intensity through the video  lol
thanks jayanti ma m
is it necessary to sort on the basis of weights 
please upload videos for greedy algorithm 
you are beautiful  madam
mam what if max weight is 50 do i really need to follow all these steps upto 50 
your are the only one who make me pass my exams  i love your teaching  you are the best teacher from which i ever studied  i wish god will meet us anywhere so that i can say thank you to you for all the knowledge that you provided without asking for any money     
thank you madam
madam advance algorithm padhayi
will we get wrong answer if we do not arrange the weights in ascending order
yay  i watched two other videos  that were also very helpful in laying the grand work for me to understand  but after watching this one  it clicked  thank you so much  
finally i understood  thank you mam
one doubt  after subtraction why should we go for previous row
mine is also the same    
she is good   
mam aap jaisa teacher mile to sabka padhai m mn lgega  aap koi bhi concept ho ekdm ache se clear kr dete ho thankuu mam
did you undrstnt the concpt if yes can you tell me  is it necessary to sort the weight array 
thanks 
i like your other videos but this time you are not explaining how things are working and only focussing on the textbook solution  why this can be solved using dp  why did you choose individual weights and total knapsack capacity as two parameters while making matrix  why did you jumped directly to matrix making 
thankyou so much jenny 
madam you are wonderful your teaching is awesome
is backtracking nd dynamic programming are two different methods of solving knapsack problem
which is best book for algorithms 
thankyou mam
thank you very much  mam  this video helped me a lot 
from 22 39 minutes i cannot understand calculation of  x1 x2 x3 x4 can you please help me with this 
same
go gate academy channel
madam  this is confusing  is there any simple method to understand   please
yes
can you please upload network flow ford fulkerson algo   its very necessary 
why so terrified   thoda sa has liya kro
what happens when we do it in the same order given in the question  not in ascending order also it gives the same answer plz reply anyone 
it will work
you explained it in a very clear way than my professor  thank you very much 
madam ji  you are a perfect combination of beauty and brain
thanks
congrats in advance  for 100k
you are  a hero
there is a mistake in the first loop  its not 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2   its 0 0 0 2 2 2 4 4 4  please verify  thanks
your explanation is the best compared to 3 other higher quality teachers i watched on 0 1 knapsack problems 
  ay9523 his explanation with solving seems difficult came to jenny mam understand successfully
same
true
very very good teacher 
awesome explaination  in every method thank you  
jenny mam  iam learning alot in ds and daa from your lectures   thanks alot to you for your great work on providing best way    i found 0 1 knapsack problem please look that we would have xi 1  0 1 0  you have written there xi 1 0 0 1   
she checked the set given in the question
this is what for i was exploring comments thanks man
yes you r correct bro
i just want to say that you r the best person in the internet to explain all these topics you r da best
mam if 2 value of weight is same then how to arrange them in ascending order either we have ascending them according to first come first put or higher profit will written first
mam please reply quickly i have to solve my assignment
how to arrange weight in ascending order if two weight were same  should we consider values for that 
madam how to find the max  value that can be put in knapsack bag
  i also explained  this concept in easy method  pls go through and subscribe
shortuct  for  2 4  we simply write the profit of it i e 3 and we add 4 3 just simply add the one i e above to 4  and gives 7 and also add profit 2 3 it gives 5 so on the 7 th column we write 5 and for 5th and 6th columns we write 3 as it is and on 8th column we write whatever that is present in 7 this is used for all the things hope you found it easy 
i just loved you are shaky voice and  you really explained very well 
thank you so much ma am this is the best explanation of 0 1 knapsack problem
please mam make videos on  all the subjects of computer science   
video is super good  it will better if you can show the data structure that can be used while sorting the weight and mapping it to product  may be in java or any other language of your choice  that would really help  thanks a lot again
mixer  really  
check out this playlist on dp by flipkart sde   
mem you can provide python example
your teaching style is the best one and you r so quite

mam your videos are very nyc can please upload network flow algorithms videos please
mam is it necessary to take weights in ascending order 
 docd5949 it is not necessary bro 
not necessary if it is not done too we get the same thing
 dheerajeerla9003 yes bro  i have done this question by considering both order  the answer will be same 
 jenny but why to write weight in ascending order   any specific reason  
mam why you took profit value 2 3 4 1
same question
toughest problem solved in the simplest way  thanks mam 
mam is this the best example to learn 0 1 knapsack problem  you teach in an easy way
thanku madam

perfect tutorial  thank you 
mam  thank you               
you are cute man  thanks for the algo though 
madam the method that we have been provided in our university book that we usually refer is so long   whereas yours method is simple and short which i would like to prefer it   but my question  is  will i get full marks by referring your method in exam   
placement hogya  
hi jenny  thanks for videos on dynamic programming  you are doing a great job   i have one question  from where we got this formula   how it was derived 
 
i love you dear
thankyou
it will be good if you explain in any single language 
you are just awesome mam wish i could have the authority to my college i would have battled with my teachers to bring you in as our algorithm teacher rock solid teaching technique god bless you mam tons of love from me to your hardwork thank you so so so so so much  
what are you doing currently 
mam aap thora haste hue video banaya kegeye   sikhne me aasani hote hai
cleared my doubts on 0 1 knapsack  thank you so much
nice yaar very nice
hindi hindi  why you do not teach in english 
thank you so much  mam
but why we not take 2 in 2nd row that means ans  is  0 1 1 0 
videos are helpful  but in this video on 6 42 where you write down your pi as   2 3 4 1  and in the problem you have written   2 3 1 4  is there any logic behind that are its just a typo 
yes and i have explained that logic in the video only  6 50
 jennyslecturescsit you have explained wi  which you said it is going to be in ascending order  but for the pi  you did not say anything  can you tell in comment what is the logic behind that  i have a test in 2 hours  i have a clear picture of what you have explained the rest but a bit doubting myself on pi part  why in the question the values are in a different orders and why you wrote in a different orders 
omg  i am so stupid thanks i got it  
thank you mam 
madam mjh ek doubt h agr knapsack ki capacity 50 h to hme 51 columns draw krne pdege
madam plz rpy
yes
mam please make video on matrix multiplication through dp
sure will upload soon
i have never seen beautiful teacher like you  pls give me you are fb id
kewal like
mam in an exam question given and weight is 50 w 50 then how we will solve how can i build table for this     please clarify my doubttt
you can solve that using branch and bound method  you cannot solve this using this method
 adityanaitan  y 
honestly  i had seen a lot of video of knapsack problem  0 1   but this video explains my every doubt    i do not want to take your more time to read this comment  overall you explained very well   
number dedo
awesome mam for this  
osom i have watched few video of you n i believe they r one of the best currently on youtube  plz upload more video on you are channel 
we want more videos on daa  well explained and you have make this topics easier for us  thank you
teaching is good  but concept is super confusing
thank you didi 
no need to sort according to weight 
if we have 10 5  weight and 10 5 profit value and we need make a total weight of  10 5 2 then is it programatically possible to evaluate 
madam aap tution bhi provide krte ho
no
thank you so much dear mam  your explanation is too  good   
better than abdul bari
arey masahallah  mar hi dalogi  haayee
thank you so much mam
jenny apu  all i understand  but  how you get the result   its look difficult for me to catch it  overall  your technique like as my favorite madam rahi   outstanding  thank you so much 
awesome mam i just share this video in official whatsapp group of my division love you 3000 mam
amazing formula thanks madam
wow
fantabulous lecture 
thanks  madam so such good explanation  please make videos on various other dp problem like cutting road  palindrome partition  box stacking  minimum sum increasing subsequence  end of array  word break problem 
more videos on dynamic programmings  please
the explanation is good  you do actually solve the problem completely  correction  we do not need to sort the weight array 
public void zerooronesolution int profit  int weights  int sackcapacity          int k    new int profit length 1 sackcapacity 1             for int i 0  i <  profit length  i              for int j 0  j <  sackcapacity  j                  if i   0   j   0                      k i j    0                      continue                                    if j   weights i 1  >  0                      k i j    math max k i 1 j  k i 1 j weights i 1    profit i 1                   else                      k i j    k i 1 j                                                    system out println max profit is     k profit length sackcapacity       
thank you mam for such good explanation  but how to solve this problem if values given as   60 100 120 and weight as  10 20 30 and capacity is w 50
chirag jadav i think it is geeks for geeks problem  am i right  because after watching this video  i search problem on geeks for geeks for practice purpose  and i get the same problem  i also think the same thing that how we will create table for that problem  but it is also easy  same as explained in the video  coloumn will be 0 10 20 30 40 50   and weight is already in decreasing order  follow the  same procedure as explained in the video  answer is 220   and combination is   0 1 1 
thank you so much  
good explanation but logic seems to be slightly wrong  for example   2  8  value should be 6 as we can have 2 4  > 2 3  6  why 5  seems like taking value from above row and adding seems to be wrong  you need to take it from same row   also  adding 0th row and column is not much useful  thanks for sharing your knowledge 
agar ap hindi ma ya urdu ma samja dain to axhi samj a sakti ha madam

awesome jenny
your video presentation are awesome its vry helpfull but from the total video you smiled only at the end  keep smile mid to mid its happy for you are health and plesant for us to see
i have a doubt mam if they ask to solve using greedy we should draw all three tables or last table is enough mam 
i love  you

thank you akka 
legends refer to this tutorial during exam and solve the questions  
total profit in 2nd approch is 41  
look at object 5  it has weight 1 and profit 8  take object 5   15 this will give profit of 120
thank you mam
complexity of the algorithm 
mam what if the ratio of profit  weight is equal for two or three cases 
in my graduation speech  i just want to say very much thanks to jenny s lectures and gate smashers and our faculty for helping us out in this pandemic situation  in which our studies are not being held

  cp65143wo chutiya muslim ka baccha teacher 4 saal se video upload nahi kiya hai
reply mam
mam all question ma 3 method karvani k only one method
what if i want all the items in the bag  and just want to break the weight to be able to put all of them is it possible in fractional knapsack or do i need to do other algorithm  please answer i need this for my research  
clear explanation  
just amazing teaching
thank q madam  thanks a lot   your classes are so helpfull for my exams daa exam 
thanks mam
it is give appropriate solution or optimal solution
thank you mam for the help
super
a lot of love madam from my side  you looking so cute  bht ache s smjtye h aap       
i love you
i love the way of you talking   
in the 3rd method i e p w method   what if we get a total weight each object weight being 1 kg   less than the max capacity 
you divide the remaining amount by the given amount  which forms the ratio needed
you got to divide suppose you have 2 space left but the weight given is 3 you do 2 3 pi
thank you mam   
mam i want to ask when i asked to solve knapsack method by greedy method then do we also have to find by other 2 cases ie by decresing weight or increasing profit or just directly by ratio case pls clarify my doubt 
amazing lecture my all concept r clear  
mam video quality aachi karo
love you  you explain in very good way
awesome   saw till 2 35 and boom got the green tick  d

thank you sooo much              
mam please make a video on activity selection problem by greedy method  it is very much required  lots of respect and thanks 
anurag pl follow  rkstudytech for all important topics
madam this method does not match with the one which given in books of ada subject as well as this method is not giving the correct answer  please respond
i think because the fractional profit is not calculated the right way  it should be  7 4 3 rather than 7 3 4 
i am the final year student of ug  this is the time of covid 19 and exam is held on this month  your video is very much useful at this time so  thanks a lot mam
what will be the correct answer if we get the same answer in approach 1 and approch 2 
no approach 1 and approch 3
 write a non deterministic knapsack algorithm  mam  help  or anyone help me in this problem some hint about this problem please
you are knowledge inspire me  thank you for this free vdos i do not know how much money you get from this but you r earning hearts  you helped me alot  
the things which you explain are just basics  but the thing which matters is the algorithm of this problem and time complexities of these algorithms  so please make videos on algorithms and how to find their time complexities 
you have such beautiful eyes  i cannot concentrate
i cannot concentrate considering the fact that you cannot concentrate xd
dear mam plz make a website and put you are work on that website and also write the link in the description box thanks alot   you are lectures are very easy and you are method is very nice

i often find in these types of talks that the speakers discuss simple concepts while glossing over the more complex parts  i am at the 1 40 to 2  18 part   talks about ratio and still yet to know what fractional means in this problem  4 15 begins the discussion of fractional finally framing the problem so i can begin to understand what she is discussing  its a problem to make videos without a real audience  if i was in the audience i would have asked what fractional meant right away 
she sugar coats the topic for much wider audience and sometime you cannot just straightaway go for some higher concept   you need to lay a proper foundation first   i think you are a very poor coder if you think like this   sorry mate 
what we have to do when  the weight we want to add is more than the remaining weight  please do reply  ty
take fractional  weight ie  only the amount of weight uh can take and in that case multiply  profit with the fraction of  weight chosen divided by total weight   as shown in the video
i love uhh 
mam can you make video on 0 1knapsack  using dynamic programming  and here conditions is value of m is too large  which means we cannot use tabular form of knapsack so how solve this problem   and how to use second approach of dynamic programming 
                                                                                                                                    esse he gyan                     bhagvan apka bhala kare

ma m you r beautiful  
thank you so much mam
cannot concentrate on leacture   replace her 
is the 3rd method always give the maximum profit
yeah  the greedy method proved that it could always support the optimal solution for the knapsack problem
thank you madam
absolutely perfect explanation about this topic carry on madam 
mast h topic or mam both

thank you
madam thoda josh high rakha karo
you did not explain the actual fractional method in example  you just simply solved the problem without having fractional value in the last  it is just a easy way to make mad us 
right brother last one the same same what if value is max and bag wait small  
 till then thank you ba bye directly hit my heart   kaash humare college me aisi professor hoti 75  attendance ke liye fine nahi lagta

mam ye tin o method likhna parega ki sirf p w ratio wala calculate krna prega
if you are asked then you can write all 3 methods otherwise the best one you will choose
 jennyslecturescsit  7 03  if the weights are equal on what basis we have to choose them  i lower object index or ii  on basis of profit  
wow interestingly grasped the topic
tq so much
 
upload n class and np class videos please 
thanks for this video tomorrow is my exam and this video had helped me a lot   
mai apni engineering aapke videos dekhke hi nikalunga   
   
really useful at last minute studies
thank you so much ma am    
good one m am
how to add 50 lines 
this explanation is not intuitive at all  there is no way to internalize this unless you memorize the approach shown
thank you sister  you explained in a slow and clear way 
mam if you have issue with english then why you do not try in hindi  you will teach better than this 
how to print those subsets  please help
kindly mention the error in the table s last row and column where it shall be 0  if i am wrong  please let me know 
       
wrong algorithm
thank you madam so much   i searched a lot about this problem i did not find a single solution as your so thank you so for explaining it in detail   
are you a pornstar bcoz i like to f you 
  for explanation why to do this 
why you choose other elem for the sum 0
how to calculate subset you said you will make a video its been 3 years
is this method using back tracking  
so cute
if the sum is given 50 then  will these tables still be feasible 
awesome
mam  i guess in the place a i 3 and sum j   4 should be 1  
can you give the link of the video in which you have calculated the subset of thhe sum 
best tutor i have ever seen on youtube   you are amazing madam
excellent explanation  you are requested to use better quality of marker
thank you mam
can you plz explain why you write 1 in column having value 0   what i understand is if we write 1 means we can make a subset and by having subset with value 2 or other  sum will not be 0  plz explain it
what if array is not sorted
thank you  mam for such an amazing explanation  it solved all my doubts  apart from other who just showed how to write code you explained how to fill the table in a really fantastic way
code bhi dena chahiye
hello  thanks a lot for the explanation  just wanted to know why are all elements set to true for sum 0 
mam how can we include the element when sum is 0
mam particular subset second vedios plz
mam you are looking gorgious
if the sum value is high it will be very complex to solve in dp   is it any other method better than dp in that case 
no one explains why we are going backwards and simply copying values  we are not here to mug things up
thanks for great interpretation 
mam can you do video on subset program
does the element of the should be return in sorted manner
no need  it will work with unsorted array as well 
is it necessary that the array a   2 3 5 7 10 needs to be sorted for this to work 
no need  it will work with unsorted array as well 
ghanta lecture  koi real explanation nhi  coding karo phle phir padaho  sabki zindagi na kharab karo glt padhake 
shitty video its just solution not how to approach
jenny the video is very help full about what we have to do   but it does not speaks any anything about why we are doing it eg at 8 56 it says we have to do sum  a i  but its not very clear why we are doing it why not sum  a j  or a i a j   
great but i did not understand how the sum can be equal to zero  first column  if i select a i  at minute 6 30 
could you make more videos on problem solving and dynamic problem
thank you  very useful
thanks for explanation  can you please tell how to arrive at this solution  in dp  each and every problems seem to be solved differently  it would be helpful if you can explain that  thanks
mam pls donot use green colour pen  saaf ni dikhta reflection aata h
will it work if the sum is odd number  i wrote code on my own based on your explanation  it is not working if the sum is odd number 
next video link plss 
tc mam     its very useful lect  mam   thank you very much   
mam please make videos on oops concepts in java
mam please make the part two of the subset sum problem 
mam  what is the time and space complexity of this algo 
mam maal lag rahe ho
mam as per your formula sum a i    when sum 8 and arr i 7    > sum a i 1 and in above row a 1 0 then  how could you can write 1 there  please explain mam
explanation is good but this is not a right way to teach dp  first we need to understand the recursive logic and when the recursive logic is developed then only we can made a dp solution  video like this did not include basics of dp and no can solve questions of dp directly by making a table  if you do not know which problem is overlapping then how you can do so

mam plz explain print all subset
24 41   it will be a   i   1     j   a  i   1       1
it is  i 1  in the first block because we are considering the previous row  but when we are subtracting j a i   we are subtracting a i  from the current row  so j a i  is correct
hey jenny this approach works if your array has only positive integers what happens in the case of negative integers being in your list 
good question
plzz make more videos on dp
this video explains whether sum exists or not  can you explain how can we find pairs  which all set of elements form the sum  for example    1 3 5 7 10 2 6    target sum   12  answer should be    1 5 6   10 2  5 7 6 2 3 1  how can we find this thing from this matrix  could you please explain this 
refer to her next video  
which one  can you please share the link to it   touchskyfacts1391
link please
 touchskyfacts1391 please bro send me the link 
mam you r teaching style is very good
great mam 
nice explanation mam  you also make easier for writing code  lot of thanks mam  
thank you so much mam  
it was such a great video mam can you make videos on  greedy algorithms 
great explanation
how does it work 
your algorithm videos have helped me alot  i am grateful to you  if you have time  could you make some videos of backtracking 
firstly   i liked her topological sort video  she did a good job  but really disappointed at this  this is exactly how everyone taught dp in my university and this is exactly not how dp problems can be understood  this is why in exams i could do dp problems but could not solve unknown problems in interviews  she should explain why she is doing what she is doing  it is all about that inuition   for example  in this case  dp i j  shows whether you can make up sum j using array elemnets 0 to i  this is a clear 0 1 knapsack pattern of dp problem  the equation is  dp i j    true  if  i 0 and j a i    j> a i  dp i 1 j a i true  how do you get to this equztion  that is what the explanation should focus on  but basically if you understand knapsack  you will get it  you can also draw a state diagram to get to this intuition  why does most of the videos say stuff like   we just copy the values from upper row  without explaining why you do that  dp problems is all about finding the recurrence relation from to move from one state to another  and most of these videos conveniently skip it  the coding part is super trivial once you have the equation    but please please do not mug it without understanding like how she tells do this then do that  understand why you need to do it 
agreed 
core logic is not explained  why you go to upper cell  go back and check in different for value  
okay now how do you code this 
 
another method is using bitsets      ll n      cin>>n      vector  arr n      for auto  it   arr  cin>>it           bitset  b 0      b 0 1           for auto x   arr          b    b<<x           cout<< write whose sum you want to check n      ll sum      cin>>sum      if b sum 1          cout<< yes      else         cout<< no 
 include  using namespace std  int main    	int n s i j  	cin>>n>>s  	int a n  	int b n 1 s 1    	for i 0 i >a i  	sort a a n   	for i 0 i<n i  	  		b i 0 1  		for j 0 j< s j  		  			if i 0  			  				if a i >j  					b i j b i 1 j  				else 				  					if b i 1 j 0  					  						b i j b i 1 abs j a i  					  					else 					  						b i j b i 1 j  					  				  			  			else 			  				if a i j  				  					b i j 1  				  			  		  	  	 for i 0 i<n i  	  		for j 0 j< s j  		  			cout<<b i j <<    		  		cout<<endl  	  	cout<<b n 1 s   
thank you mam
madam at  20 15 you said there will be another video of subset problem can you please give link for the same thank you in advance
can you explain me how to solve any problem by using dynamic programming  
thank you madam  for this concept 
madam second video 
thank you  well explained 
mam plz put queen problem
what if the asked weight is too large like 100 or something  then we need to prepare a table for that  not sure if dp should be used here 
how to write code for it 
why people do not explain the intuition behind problems    can you explain why we take value just from above cell vs taking value from the delta 
many many thanks 
cute mam cute explanation  love you mam 
can you please provide the code
 
maim please upload the second video of this to find out the particular subset  
best explanation i have found on this algorithm  i spent over 2 hours watching other videos without being able to grasp it  came across this one and it clicked  thank you 
mam what if the we have given sum like 245
hello riya   teaching very good
divide and conquer leads dividing main problem in to subproblems 
great video    plz upload a series on fibonacci heap and binomial heap i will greatly appreciate it  thanks  
kitho veer g tusi
nice explanation mam
 amazing explanation saved my lot of time thanx mam   
 jenny it will be helpful if you can explain how to deduce that we should be creating table in this manner  and  how it is concluded that we need to use this formula  this would help in actual logic building 
probably she does not know and have only by hearted it and started teaching
you are so cute
excellent  
the  mplementat on  s not correct s nce  a i j a i   part  is  the reason of array index out of exception error  but the explanation is correct the easiest way of implementtaion of this problem is recursive
mam please upload more problems on dynamic programming
very good explination  i have one question  is it necessary that the set should be in increasing order for creating dp table 
yes otherwise the maximum sum will yhe sum of all positive number in the array
mam please give me an example of back tracking
check my video about it
please upload hd video quality
very nice explanation  loved it  but madam  please explain why we are going to one cell back and then subtracting the value of i and getting the value of that cell  if the value in previous cell is 0  and if it is 1 we directly copy 1 please explain the logic behind this 
you are targeting to get sum listed on top row  when your cell value is  left column  less than sum you are looking for   you are going back and see whether that difference can be achieved  by looking at that cell  the sum value listed in the top 
madam please make a video on square root decomposition
first of all thank you very much for your explanation  but small suggestion instead of directly hitting the solution kindly try to explain the logic behind that i e why we are following dp approach to solve this why backtracking is not good  it is like how we can solve this question   and your answer is dp  but y 
actually i have discussed the need of dp in one of my videos  you can check out the playlist dynamic programming 
can you solve it with state space tree
mam  please avoid uploading in just 360p  it might appear fine now but people would hit dislike on your good content when era of 5g and 4k arrives  think long term for your channel 
please make a video of how to find a subset thank you 
use backtracking   go back from the last column last row 1 and note down the row numbers as you proceed back   you will get the subset
i came across lots of videos on the internet for this particular problem  but none of them were able to explain in such a decent and nice way like you  very well explained  thanks a lot  
kidding 
 arunakampati4365  worst hai woh  bas outdated c language ka incomplete pseudocode deta hai  waise toh hum bhi explain kare par ek code karke dikhaiyye   wastage of time on his videos
dhjrfklkyggfcszcjo
 pg9645 c language is outdated 
 sdwysc to be honest he should have shown the implementation as well  i love his way of explaining but a implementation would be cherry on cake 
how to find those subsets 
thanks
mam where is the 2nd part  
great explanation
hello mam  is this solve by using backtracking
yes you can
nic
beautifully explain by you
very good madam
it is always the low resolution video 
very nice explanation

excellent  thank you 
how baba wil be subsequence for x or y  alzo baab part of x but not y   is the subsequence considered continous or not  kindly elaborate
good
 hindi baab p     marathi baba   father  one like for it  
other channel could not make me understand 
okey mam thnq  only you can make me understand this topic 
why cannot abab be a possible answer for this  
please please please complete this dynamic programming series playlist              
thank you
video is useful
mam please make a video on amortized analysis along with it is three methods aggregate accounting potential
thank you so much madam  
wonderful explanation i have ever seen  
mam agar ap hindi mai bologe toh shyad or ache se samja pagoe i think
bhai english me padhna seekho agar cs ki padai krni hai just a friendly advice     aur mam ka padaya hua sbko smhme aata hai yr
              
lovely video and great explanation madam  keep it going with each and every subject      
aakhri ne maximum kitne longest subsequences likh de that sill be sufficient in exam 
after 20 58 your sequence is going wrong  you have changes the direction in the last row column to upward side  now you have to change the direction of others      to    to the upward direction to find lcs efficiently  after changing last  4  direction to upward your   lcs would be abab   
at first i thought it would be a boring lecture  because of no intro and lack of grammar  but as i continued to watch  i realised that her words were on point and straight forward   explanation was no more and no less than required  if she would have said the formula earlier then i would have stopped watching because i am scared of math  sometimes complex problem can be explained by just simple words and gestures which is all it takes 
amazing video madam   
mam the only problem is light reflection in board
after watching this video i got to know that you speak hindi also   i thought you speak only english at first
lol bhai muje bhi yahi laga
longest subarray in c video kindly post mam
gooodddd  you explain better than my teacher that also explain very well 
thank you madam
for abcd we are getting only 15 sub sequences
slurp slurp
brave girl
thank you
thanks mam both combined spoke in english and hindi   i understood this topic
thank you for the great explanation really i am going to pass my exam becuase of you
 
madam where this lcs actually exist in computer 
thank you mam
you are an amazing teacher madam
today is my sem 4 exam and i am watchlist this video at 2 37 am
so how is you are exam 
 jennyslecturescsit fail hogya
superb mam
i watched the topic frist from abdul bari sir but i could not understand the topic from him but after watching your video the topic is becoming so simple for me thank you mam 
same happened with me but i also could not understand topic from him
thanks didi i learned a lot from you
nicely explained
i am getting baab is that correct
the way of explaining is another level   thanks madam for wonderful explanation   
madam figure clear nhi ara    plz draw clear
youtube i want 10x speed      
thankyou mam    have you any student like you  
teaching is good  easy explanation  but one request  pls  use good  marker pen  in most of your videos marker is worst   
mam aapka method galat hai mai fail hogaya apki wajah se abhi back ka paper de raha hu  
thankuhh  means a lots mam
madam please try to be aside from the whiteboard for a few seconds so that we can get the clear visibility of the board and we can take proper screenshot and notes  pls ensure that you use dark marker 
thank you madam  
how much 
brilliant and easy to grasp thankyou
am stuck with quality at 360p
thank you mam  
after this video i am goona subscribe this channel very good explained mam  
thank you so much mam  amazing explanation  
total subsequence is equal to 2 n  as no  of subset of a set is 2 n  which also contains empty set   hence i guess here also one string is going to be empty  bcd        b   c     d   because   cd   bd    bcd    now 2 n  2 3  8
i have no word 
the second string is not baab it is abab 
i am getting the answer as  abab  can you reverify
how will the student study if the mam is this pretty
really you are  the best lecturer among all  keep it up love you so much 
i love you mam   the way you explain things has made me fall in love with you   
this is great for memorizing the process  but i find this explanation much more intuitive    as in  what is really going on in this table 
please   mam take a new pointer   
i know only java but this explaination is top class   everything crystal clear  please make video on java and dsa also
what the row and column has different letters 
wo subsequence  baba  ques me hi ni h madam  
excellent mam  all concepts learned 
thank you for this wonderful explaration         
crystal clear explanation 
tq mam
kitchen is the place for you
thanks a lot madam for saving my mid terms 
thanks mam to make it easy  
always so helpful  thank you for you are videos    
love you   
mam respect from pakistan <3
this algo will not work if there are multiple  > 2  input strings  i could create a different algo  will update here if that algo works in code  jenny s algo runs in o s s  time  whereas my algo runs  for multiple i p strings  in o n s s  time s  size of strings  let us assume max size among the strings  n    of i p strings
implemented a dp algo that can generate longest common subsequence s  from multiple input strings o n s s  time to build dp data o n   2 s  time to get longest common subsequence this is in worst case in real time  this would be very fast  because as we move from dp data of 1 string to the next  the data to compare exponentially decreases   coz we are looking for common  i e  intersection  subsequence  but not union
app beautiful ke sath sath intelligent bhi bahut hoo mam
thank you madam your lectures are just amazing 
excellent explanation  
thank you so much mam for clearing this topic for me    
thanku you so much mam  
you have an excellent pedagogy at explaining algorithms  thanks
videos is good mam is good but explanation is not perfect like professionals
you are the best 
irritating  talking style is very bad
thank you madam    god bless you   
thank you  jenny  this is crystal clear
i hope afterr you are lecture i will  clear my exam  
row and column interchange kr dene pr subsequnce abab aarha hai  is this also correct 
thank you so much   now i understand it    
i think no of subsequence is 2power n  1 bcoz only 15 possible sequence for abcd and 7 subsequences for bcd
you are osmm mam  
best step by step explanation  
thank you so much madam    now it is very easy to understand  
thank you so much much mam   we love your way to teaching  its excellent
thanks madam  this video is very helpful for understanding this topic
hi mam  the way you teach  make simple and easy way of understanding the complicated topics  you have such a teaching talent thanks for the video 
all credit for passing my algorithm analysis course goes to jenny madam 
6 20 why is the 1st row and coloum taken as 0 
madam can you please also provide algorithm for this it will be so helpful
  
thank you mam  very helpful
thank you madam
so nice and easy  method thanks
thank you very much mam god bless you with most desirable thing  for you
your teaching is very amzing your approach is too good you looking gorgeous thank you for teaching easily and intrestly      
jenny madam  i like your lectures very much  your method of teaching is very good  i am from pakistan doing mscs  hats off to you madam 
very well explained
mam please tell us what are all the programming techniques to solve geeksforgeeks and leetcode problems
thank you mam for this video
didi please buy new marker
i am from bio   but love the way you teach  
 
watching in 2x mode  anyone else  superb easy explaination
you did not explain tha logic behind taking the diagonal value and maximum value
mam i am from iit guwahati   according to me you are an emerging indian talent 
excellent explanation  thankyou
very well explained mam
great explanation  the key to understanding these types of questions is the ability to visualize  once visualization happens the algorithm become a cakewalk 
nan
where do you live madam
yippeeeeee  so lovely video  you are the best hindi teacher
madam aapki teaching bhot yummy hai
thanks
i have a question  why do we consider 0 as a sub sequence of a string even thought it do not contain any character from the sting 
at 5 51   why the first column and first row values are 0 
completed the playlist    
thank you for all your videos  please make more videos on dynamic programming  it is a complicated topic for me and your explanations are the best
thanks a lot  you made it very simple to understand 
plzzzzz upgrade your video s quality mam thank you for  this video
engineering students crush   marry me  
good explantion
madam  i just wish i could learn all gate subjects from you face to face  you make these topics so much easy and crystal clear   lots of respect to you  
what is gate  are not these faang interview questions 
tip   watch video at 1 25x playback speed     thank me later
love you mam this is 7 mark question for my 70 marks exam paper  10  in 20 minute
awsome explanation  thank you
thank you madam finding the proper dp visualization for me thanks a lotttt mam 
thank you mam
why to add 1  to its top left diagonal if charis matched
to pass your exam if you want to learn dp wit logic why and how etc checkout aditya varmas youtube channel
why to take max of left  and up if char is unmatched
good aunty
thnkyu jenny mam
thank you mam  your lectures so helpful 
concept of lcm is clear   thank you
mam  will you make more videos for dynamic programming  as the previous ones are really helpful and i want more
found this with easy explaination and github code    
thank you so much madam   
lecture ko dakho ya madam ko            
thanks for the video  well understood this algorithm 
did you slip into hindi a couple of times in the beginning there 
thanks madam
video quality is low
madam can you upload matrix chain multiplication video
mam i am facing problem while solving an example   write a complete program to find the length of  minimum subsequence of  1  in the given string of  0     1  s
i returned to your channel and lecture after 1 month and it felt like i am home atlast for learning daa   dsa  thank you madam from the bottom of my heart  you are the reason i am able to grasp these topics and learn daa and dsa  i will be grateful to you 
setup
shatop 
 
coast of
explanation is really good mam   keep it up   
how we recognize the dircetion 
what if characters are not same while checking the diagonal arrow position  will we write that character or skip 
very very very very very very very very very very very very bad way to explain dynamic programming 
i love you mam
thank you so much i love you jenny
thank you madam you explained it very clearly
rewriting with the empty marker the struggle is real
thakuu so much mam      
great explanation but can you please elaborate on which basis  everytime table formula changing  means in early scenarios we were taking values from i 1 or sometimes i 1  sum   a i  now we are taking x i 1 j 1    i am little confuse with this part
it is as per the question  we have to see what we want  and how we can derive present result from previous calculation
what is the intuition for this  it would be great if you could explain that as well
missing result abab  madam
you are very cute and your teaching is hundred times better than my professors   
thank you madam
mam isme dono ans nikalne pdhenge kya means 4 ki up value nd side value ke regards plz reply   
 naveen no teerthanker mahaveer university moradabad mca  
 naveen haan hogya yr ni aaya ye exam mai         
 naveen best of luck buddy
thank you so much  great explanation  kindly explain it with recursion and memoization
thanks mam
lots of thanks  before watching this video  i thought i would never understand this algorithm  
if string containing space then how to handle space  e g  abdc def 
possible number of longest subsequence  is total number of time 4 presnt in tha table
where is the intuition
mam also make provide on matrix chain multiplication algo 
your learning technique and you also looking very beautiful
thank you much young teacher   you are awesome  
cool video  thanks for sharing it 
please do not look or stare at the camera for more than 3 seconds  it is horrific awkward      
thank you for explanation
prefect explaination thanks
mixing of the languages has confused me little though
madam explanation was very nice  madam but marker seems to be quite dry  please refill it 
how did you reach to the formula  logical explanation pls  this way we will just end up mugging the solution
absolutely where is the intuition
we are watching this just to clear exams
this  yotube channel only to clear exams not for logical thinking
the logical explanation of this formula is based on recursion using two pointer method  it is like if both elements are equal than increment both i and j pointer else first increment only i pointer reach base case case and then increment j pointer and find maximum length of lcs
you are making great effort to explain the topic   nice explanation
thank you very much mam
thanks a lot  
thank you   explained very well and your videos have been very useful in understanding the concepts you are covering 
thank you  it is clear and easy to understand 
super explanation
thank you  in this lockdown your lectures helped me a lot  
thanku mam 
love from bangladesh mem
for the max c i j 1 c i 1 j   if c i j 1  and c i 1 j  has same value  what direction should the arrow point to 
you can either take the arrow pointing left or up  as they are having the same value 
thanks
this is the best tutorial i have seen on this topic  you explain the basics  best in your videos madam 
everything is crystal clear mam 
you can watch this video for variation of lcs   
bit slow but good enough to understand the topic 
agr ap na hoti tu hmra kia hota  thanku mam for pak 
y you shivering audio is nt at all present try speaking louder 
jenny ji ye logic bana kese method samajh aagya but logic samajh nahi aaya can you please explain
plz can you make video on matrix chain multiplication
thank you so much   2hours left for online exam and using this video  i did this problem in 7 min only thank uh
can anyone explain that why do we take element at diagonal and add 1 when string char matches and when it does not match why we take max of up and left element
jenny madam i do not know how to reach out to you but i hope you will surely read my comment  will you please explain one more question  and the question is we will have some numbers in a subset and our task is to divide a subset into two parts such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is minimum  i have used you r previous video subset sum logic to solve but i want to know is there any best solution specifically for this question 
what will be the algorithm code  for printing the answer 
thank you for your efforts madam  the shared videos are very helpful and easy to understand  please keep doing good work 
 hello madam does this end the dynamic programming series  please answer  pretty important for me 
thank you    thank you so much   your teaching is very clear and helpful for me and you so beautiful look your eyes is     
aapne google me apply q nhi kiya onspot selection hota aapka
amazing 
mam is it tabulation method 
you did not mention why you r taking max 1 from diagonal and max from upper and left  
mam please  you are amazing  make videos on dp on trees 
your videos are awesome  clear and concise
thankyou soo much mam
you teach great  you should get an award from modi uncal
thank you madam  if you do not make these videos then i could never get the subjects i see maximum of your videos they really help me a lot
kindly also make  videos on backtracking 
thank you mam you r my favorite mam my doubts is clear  
mam please tell me how to remember this trick or method for long time 
perfection level 100  madam
 2 n 1  subsequences are possible except 0 length string  thank you madam 
you should explain  why this method worked and from where it came instead of explaining 
mam you are really a boon for us keep smiling  forever 
abcd 2 4 subsequence   i cannot find 16 subsequence  how 16   can you pls explain
you are a hero  thank you so much <3
heroine bolle bhai      
great mam even i were not learnt this much during my technical degree   thanks for brushing up our concept 
you are such a great teacher madam   
try to explain why do we need two parameters to define a state 
so flipping any leftward or upward  can derive a longest sub sequence 
madam where you from    plzz
hi jenny  could you please create dp matrix video for hackerrank abbreviation problem as well   t if you could use following test case that would be fantastic  halxbqau albq it would be great if you could use string2  albq  as rows and string1 as columns of the matrix
nice explanation in detail it is excellent mam
   
thanks madam  for your easiest way to explain us  you lecture make us interested in ds and algo by the way your expression at 25 40 min was awesome 
madam will it always be the same character when we are going to the upward   i mean like in both row and column like a a  b b like this  or sometimes different 
madam plz parsing karwa dian
beauty with brain is always dangerous  dear respected mam teaching methodology is just great
thanksssssssss
i can use hashmap on 1st string and count all occurrences of alphabets  while looping through the 2nd string  if there is a match  i l add 1 to counter  and in the  end counter will give lcs  right   why do this way  time complexity  
ok got it sequence should be same 
hey you sir checkout     you will understand time complexity and all your answers here 
awesome lecture
thank you so much mam love from bd
 mam dp ka complete series laiye nd competative programing par bhi koi series layiye plss mam
thanksss  
awesome madam you are teaching techniques are very very efficient and effective
can we please have more videos of dp 
i think you should explain the intuition behind the two formulae   when x i y j  then c i j    1  c i 1 j 1  we take the length of lcs  without including the matching character from both the strings  and then add 1 to it  to include the matching character  when x i y j  then c i j    max c i 1 j    c i j 1  we consider the length of lcs excluding x i  and the length of lcs excluding y j  and then take the max of the two 
hey this explanation and complexity and approach all are here     you sir check it out  you will love this 
mam also make video on matrix chain multiplication algorithm as early as
you are great yr
thanks your explanation is awesome 
mamm please use black marker this will shut on board as well as on you
main  if string s  day    println  less concentration      else   printf i love you maammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm     write the correct output of given code
error lol
prinltln is for java
 equals is used to compare strings
might you will feel better with c  checkout same problem with c  and fun at    
this is real women empowerment   unlike those fake feminists
mam yours lecture is very helpful but please change the camera your video is very brightness and the word you write on whiteboard is some time blur
very helpful in  analysis of algorithms   thank you madam 
nice lecture very easy to understand thanks madam i am from pakistan 
salam from pakistan  appreciate you
explanation method is outstanding 
great work 
poor explanation
hey man you should checkout     you will love this video for sure 
kon chutiya dislike marta h  jab madam itni achi padathi h  keep going madam do not care about the dislikes 
ab ni hota re pass   
madam ji aaa menu kadi v sam ni ayea tuci chnd mint mein clearrr kr diaaa
  
nicely explained 
pura to bata diya karo madam
concept clear thanks mam
now only my concept is clear  big thank you jenny madam 
excellent
awesome  
no  of longest common subsequence kaise find krenge
i would ask jenny for a coffee if we would be in same city    she is beauty with brains   
shi khel gya bhai  same
 dipendrasinghrawat571 compliment kiya bhai khela kaha  
great teacher  would it be possible for you to explain the egg drop problem 
please do not rely on this  formulas  not helpful to a person understanding data structures  understand how recursion does this  why there is overlapping problem  how memoization is used   then dynamic programming and then finally this table  see other videos on youtube  
very helpful to me mam  thanks for this  
what is your full name mam 
jayantikhatrilamba
ya that is your address but what about your full name
 yashshende2786 haha  
i am from bangladesh   your lecture is just wonderful
ms  pls make vdo of matrix chain multiplication   
samajhne wala stuff nahi hai bhai pagal ho jata hu dekhte dekhte itna khatarnak topic hai wo
mam why not make video in hindi  
bigger audience 
amazing
what is the difference between up arrow and left up arrow
there is no such  left up arrow  the arrows point to the maximum cost you choose 
if the max value is to the left  then left arrow is used  otherwise  right arrow  if both left and right values are same  any one of the arrow can be considered 
rip to our fallen friend  the green marker
great explanation 
thanks mam 
vowww       
thanks mam  please make videos on backtracking
output should be abab right 
no its baba  we will start writing from right to left 
x position is col and y is row then ans become a abab its true or not  
last main ans subsequence kahan hain b a b a kaise
thanks   you and you are expalination is too good
excellent  but  if you use only english  it will helpful for many students 
perfect 
madam thank you so much
shi h beta 
love the explanations    
thank you mam  good explain
thank you  so much for explaining it in a very easy way  channel subscribed bell button clicked 
so simply explained mam as always  thankyou  
thank you so much mam   
thanks
madam  please respond to my mail  i have sent some cases where i was failing by applying the logic 
you have not yet replied to my mail madam 
  bhogeswarasaikumar6351 happy birthday
hey man  you should checkout this video      if you are suffering with the logic of longest common subsequence 
beautiful  
nice explanation  but how the problem is solved using this matrix  means how can we think that it can be solved creating such matrix 
surprisingly nobody asked this question and everyone simply accepted the formula  none of the youtube videos explains why a matrix is used for this problem   
in the matrix  a i j  represents the value of max common subsequence when we take the first i characters of string a and j characters of string b  we start from 1st char of string a and b  now from these value we derive what if one more character is added to either of the strings 
 abdulrehman ew5fu that is called dynamic programming it is a method to solve very complex programming questions
 hareeshr3979 thanks a lot    i am amazed
thankyou mam 
really nyc tuto you cleared all my doubts of max 4 4 
excellent mam  we need more tutorials from you over computer science
thankuuu mam  
it is tricky
 patelprince3790 if you have a good iq then its not tricky
hey guys you should checkout     for different way is explaining
madam such a great teacher you are thank uh      
nice explanation didi 
intuition is missing 
very nice explained
why so beautiful 
why so sick 
so  being a female dose not give you an advantage in teaching business   
itni panchayati kyun krni hoti hai  concept smj ke nikl na bhai  gjb free aadmi hai   tujhe  kya lgta hai  channel tere faltu ke dicussion ke liye hai  ya kuch achi kam ki concept se related baat k liye 
grow up dude  i am sure you are doing be or btech or some other higher education  still you talk like an uneducated moron 
beautifully explain by you
awesome explanation
good explanation babe
woah
too  good explanation 
nice
