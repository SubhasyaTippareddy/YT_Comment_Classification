i just came to watch this to know how pewdiepie would react after seeing mrbeast passed him in subs  did not expect this 
the funny thing is that s what mr beast said he was going to do was help you get tour channel over 1 hundred million and then he is going to smash you in subs 
mrbeast really passed you know lol

buddishm is real i am buddist in sri lanka
thanks i am mr beast fan
pewdiepie i know it is been a long time since mr  beast surpassed your subscribers  i know you might feel a little bad or inferior for letting this happen  but you cannot let that leave you behind  you were the youtube star for a long time  upload more videos and content if you put your mind to it you will achieve it
the title is a joke  he has said multiple that he does not care about it and that he is basically retired
i have declared if mrbeast is higher at subs but he still do not have good content like this
jimmy  245m felix  111 2m
this shits on mr beast
mr beast may be number one in subs  but pewdiepie is number one in my heart
at this point pewdiepie is not just a celebrities  pewd is a part of us now  we are not bros  we are uncles now    
pewdiepie sent mrbeast to conquer and destroy t series
in dream    
new book review eventually 
interesting
now mrbeast is at 236 million
236m 111m
you got cucked
pewdiepie off his meds again
all jokes aside this talk was very helpful  learned alot from you  pewdiepie is my philosopher
you are the real king always 
as shit
i think aristotle might have been married to a child that is why he thought that women had less teeth than men 
zaqee	kelpsp
this guy stucked in 111
well that s not going to last forever he might sadly go down to 110m in the near future never getting to 112m
11 57 11 56
he will beat t series for you 
you r waaaaaay than that greedy idiot
youtube is being so inconsistent with their recommendation system 
i feel like watching pewds makes my brain large   
now will you write a rap song against him too  b tchdiepie         
you still mad     
here win mrbeast has 222 million therefore  making him two times the amount of subscribers as pewdiepie
wow i have not checked your channel for so long and have never watched mr  beast  so i kind of just realised that you are not the biggest yourtuber with 40mio followers anymore  
pewdiepie is still the  
pewdiepie pls stop videos not like do again why people stop subscribe your channel
twice as many now
yassss now that is one of my favourite parts of your channel <3
felix is still the true and real   1
 
this is what happens to people who are        
      
based
yotube god   pewdiepie
you do not know what buddhism is
he never claimed to
i thought mr beast had like 30 mil he has two hundred thirty four mil jesus christ
i just found out that pewdiepie s channel is now done growing
kind of dead just 1  subs are active
t series face off round 2  like this to get mr beast on board with beating t series the one time 
the sub gap between mrbeast and pewdiepie has reached 100 million just a week ago 
pewdiepie will always be the og greatest youtuber of all time
wewe dielive  ah yesh thanks pewds
jeg er fra norge      i am from norway
you may not be the king anymore  but you are still the most loved king of youtube there ever was
the first king
so if i already have a strong reaction to kelly clarkson  what does not kill you makes you  as you say  does that mean i have already surpassed all these pieces of kinlin 
i can control bowls and plates with my mind  i have been amassing an army of dishes and we will rise up against the universe 
meu deus  at  hoje voc  continua com 111 milh es de inscritos  kkkkk n o subiu nem 1 milh o kkk
for the love of god where is the next book review felix i miss saying doki doki even though you do not play that song anymore
10 month ago mr beast 105millions and pewdiepie 111millions >now mr  beast 205millions and pewdiepie 111millions
the fact that it hasn t even been a year and he s already about to be 100 million subs ahead of him is insane  mr beast s growth is unreal bro
idiotic choice of books
trash books
cringe
pewdiepie mrbeast is about to pass over t series with 207million subscribers and he is getting 233k subscribers per day and t series has 252million subscribers and getting subscribers 59k subscribers per day 
i never watched him lmao glad someone came alone n became the new number one
bros name really epic titties 
mr beast now 100 million subs above you
i     
hi
the thing is  if he read those books before becoming famous he would not have become famous  the point about reaching the top is craving the top more than others 
you will never hit 112million subcrber
you right he created this video since 10 months he still did not get 112m subscribers he still has 111m subscribers
mrbeast dobrou os inscritos kkkk
he has 203 million now
and now he s got 205 million
yep he beats pewdiepie
it s a hard time for pewdiepie now it s been 10 months and he is stuck with the same subs since then 111m
it s been 22 months since 111m
first pewdiepie video i ever watched
where do you live one more time
bye  bye  bunny pie    
you make mr  beast before or not  i saw the video meeting mr  beast but this is a long time ago  when you see this message  you have to tell everybody
and what are you doing i am still worse than you or not
anyway this video is a banger
mr williams is top of you  but you have to make your heart decisions
mr busy topping you donid1878 t care about it  you didnid1878 t  you want to be a topic again  then why you just make a best you double you ever sing

how you are growing so slow everyone will pass you
you will still be number 1 in our hearts pewds
1 54  
lots of his subs are also you re subs
noob pewdiepie 
yea 
18 09 2023
in current
hey pewdiepie mrbeast is the 2nd most subcribed channel in the world
logic  look the budget in his videos when you juste stock everything you earn in bank  totally fair 
damn  so 9 months ago pewdiepie was at 111 million subs and today he  is still at 111 million  that is crazy 
that is because mrbeast been helping him saying subscribe to pewdiepie but now he stopped at 111
a bro or a litteral walking money bag   choose
i saw his book on the list at the beginning  and i waited for it   is it my fault that i thought he would bring up the past that could have helped him see how the past should not be held to standards of his future  edit  i guess i did not wait to make this comment xd
since 8 months ago pewd s subs stayed the same  while jimmy s subs skyrocketed to 180 million
                               
team mr beast            
mr beast got 180m
mrbeast subscriber 180 million subscribers
anyone going to talk about how he wanted a better car to flex on her ex  which means he s gay  
meme he fucked up
mrbeast the best
if mrbeast passes you in subs  you are not going to pass him back  dafuqboom in 2025 be like  am i a joke to you
t series  yes  give me what your daddy could not
i do not know why i love you  i am an arab  
why do you not get more subscribers  you have had 111million for months
i think people did not subscribe to pewdiepie now people subscribe to mr beast
  unknowntonesno  because he is retired youtuber of 3 years
                                               
you still have 111 m  
why is no talking about sleeping on epictetus   
he sounds like that bad guy in sponge bob square pants
i am waiting for someone to actually comment about the book review in the video and not the video title
felix redpilled 
do not worry  mrbeast will pass t series for you 
pewdiepai pewdiepai
the reason why your subscriber does not increase is the lack of dubbing 
na bro
let s delve deeper with pewdiepie  together
5 27   do not sleep on epictitties 
it is ok  no hate  but it is ok  pewdiepie than mr  beast my personal opinion lol  is mr  beast married  no  or i do not know lol  does mr  beast have a kid  no  did we watch mr  beast at the age of our childhoods to adulthood  watching him grow may be probable but for me  pewdiepie is more inspiring  because he is just doing life and youtube  while growing up and seeing us grow up as well 
by the way mrbeast has 174m subs
did we ask 
 patchy angel had i said it to you  
mrbeast is the cream of the crop for now
scenes when jimmy hits 300m while pewdiepie is still on 111m
you both are at 29 billion views  hope he does not surpass you
mrbeast did surpass him  he has 30b now 
you are still stuck in 111m whereas mrbeast got to 173m as of now  i remember back in the days when i started watching mr beast he got his custom play button nd all  and you were at 100m subs  you were a legend 
s ubs
i want a viral slaps    
on 200mil    
see you there
now what 
0 00
after like 5 years or more being the number 1 youtuber  a replacement has finally arrived  but we will never forget the one who controlled the youtube kingdom for years  a great felix
you are still 111 million sub  this is weird 
if you post youtube shorts you will get a higher chance of coming back at mrbeast   being  1 again 
i prefer mrbeast
mrbeast 28 9b views vs 29b pewdiepie 
of course he did  you are not the same old gaming pewdiepie anymore  you destroyed it  you got them followers from gaming your carrer started from gaming and you threw it away 
there aren t enough words to express how happy i am for you and marzia  absolutely amazing people and i get so much genuine happiness seeing you guys live your best life  i wish you and marzia the absolute best and i m so happy to have been apart of supporting such wonderful people  keep being yourself  
pewdiepie will always be a legend  a man who didn t  try  to be the biggest  he just became that by being himself and continues to be himself even now  sure you get less views by being yourself but we all love you felix and you re one of the few people in the world to have the amazing privilege to do what you enjoy in life and people want to enjoy it vicariously through you  much respect and love  
wah  this video really inspire me sia  me love how you talk about happiness and how it is not just about money or fame  but about finding meaning and purpose in life  me been through some tough times  including a stint in jail  but me realize that happiness come from within and cannot be bought or stolen  me also think it is amazing how mr beast have so many subscribers and use his platform to do good in the world  it is inspiring to see someone who have so much influence use it for a positive purpose  like helping others and making the world a better place  thank you for sharing this video  it really make me think about life differently and appreciate the simple things  me going to keep striving for happiness and purpose in me own life  and me hope to inspire others to do the same 
 ubs 
you are still  1 to millions  i may not watch your content much these days  but you were a positive force in my teen years  thank you for doing what you love for the sake of entertaining  brofist   
salut  j adore tes vid os  
no he is not lol
i feel like i always see this guy comment in every video i watch
  ehthmgsame
  uhm175lol shut up
omg i am subcribed to you
pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  a gamer  a news presenter  a gym bro  a philosopher  basically an older brother we have never met but became a significant part of our lives 
why the fuck do i keep seeing your comments loo
stolen lmao
clickbait for knowledge  xd love it   
he still was the first solo youtuber to reach 100million subs and he retired
mr  beast is probably going to tell his friends to unsubscribe because his idol is pewdiepie and he doesn t want a passimum and subscribers
hahaha 
he almost said wealth fame power
pewdiepie                       
111
jake cruise  85m mr beast 83m
t series always rock
sorry
mrbest
i am pretty sure mrbeast is winning due to variety of age in his subscribers  because most kids do not watch pewdiepie    and probably should not lmfaooo
rus rus  plz bro subtitrs rus plz

i always come back to this video when i am feeling  a little bit annoyed  this video is just like therapy to my mind    this video make me feel better
i got to read some of the books pewdiepie talks about
mrbeast deserves the subs but pewdiepie is still great
i loved pewdiepie s philosophy book review 
the big brain move would be that this hole video was an ad 
imagine   mrbeast vs t series  would be the best sequel 
nah bro doubt it   just remember even though mr beast keep getting new subscribers so is t series  plus india has a huge population with over a billion and also there is people from some countries that subscribe to t series

at this point i m just waiting for mr beast to hit 1 billion subscribers lol 
and pewds still at 111m subscribers
 
i think a couple of honorable mentions are alan watts s  the book  and ekhart tolle s  the power of now   ekhart tolle especially is an amazing writer and his philosophy on ego and self are really interesting and have been really helpful to me on my journey 
and now he has 157 mil
pewdiepie i feel so bad for you 
best boring channel ever
k skanma lan

belkide seni ge mesinin sebebi o videolar na dublaj yaparken senin altyaz  bile koymamand r 
well how the student has become the master and the master has become the student
well t series had more subs than felix way before mrbeast surpassed him
sad
you should of played happy wheels instead   
pevbeipei vs mr beast mr beast
old youtube was 2012 1016 man smosh vanoass and all those go youtubers
bro is learning buddhism  by the way i am buddhist 
read quran pewds
you still   to billions
do not worry your stil the best gamer your just in the second place
mr beast deservess itt
keep doing these book reviews    
mr beast make people happy help people in need and he stays with his content i stop watching the videos when you stop gaming
mr  beast saves lives  helps the homeless  pays for expensive surgeries  gives money and much more   
mrbeast past his dad in subs 
i have declared  
mrbeast deserves that because he helps all over the world with his money agau donations 
in five months  mrbeast has gotten nearly 40 000 000 more subscribers
you would have never had 100 mil if mrbeast never made shout outs to you
i can just see his soul dieing inside him
i did not know you were still alife or had content that was not pure cringe it is good to see you  d i unsubscribed a few years ago  but now i have re subbed to help you are fight against mrbeast  though i think am subscribed to him to   which i did not really want to but figured he has decent content time to time
do not worry  i feel that both have their own since their content usually varies and despite that it has nothing to do with it because for all of us you will always be the eternal number 1 on youtube and in our hearts 
too lonely at the top
pewdiepie i love you
pewds coming back to indian content basically
are you jealous of mrbeast 
he does not care that mrbeast is passing him  they are both friends with their own content
mrbeast is the greatest fan of pewdiepie
love book review man live by the book die by the book
mrbeast past 150m subs   
11 40 ay yo a book loves me
how is this relevant to mrbeast pasing you in subs
i never expected this from pewdiepie  
you are old
why don t you make a distrack like you did a few years back out of jealousy 
he will do whatever he wants  go cry in a corner
i am a buddhist   so glad
pewdiepie still a  
mr  beast don t deserve it
true
wtf yes he does he has changed many people s life s for the better
  sewerynrozanski8319how 
sez you  
00 00  00 03   00 04 mrbeast has taken over me in subscribers  but i have one secret tricks of my sleeve
mrbeast gain more subs better than you
 
4 48 and youtube 
i remember a few years ago i used to pronounce pewdiepie as  pee woo dai pai 
a note for myelf  stuff he said was uproot cravings instead of fulfilling or avoiding them  try to achieve eudamonia instead of superficial happiness  realize that some events are out of your control and some are in our control there is no point in anger at uncontrollable events  nihilism is pessimistic  the existence of suffering is what allows us to feel happy in contrast
 this book loves you  was actually the first book i bought for myself  i was like 15y o 
filosify   love it
pewds will always be  1 in my heart man
love this video  i feel i came looking for coal and ended up finding diamonds  so thanks for that 
mr  beast is now at 148 million
wow and the fact that at one time mr beast was even trying to help pewdiepie be the most subbed person on youtube is crazy
i would not agree that anger is not a useful emotion it can be a powerful motivator to 
try reading quran  i am sure you will love it 
no
  happypaws24yes
brighten your day  why did pewdiepie become a youtuber  he did not want to  sven  his time doing something else 
du  r svensk
10 23  pewds   or to be that one person who brings up the double slit experiment in every single conversation  me    looks away   sorry 
i suggest you read the quran if you want to 
      your dog
                                                                                                                                                       
00 03   00 04

epictits my favorite youtube philosopher

mrbeast give poor people money better then you pewdiepie
 felix
 than
so what 
you are 100x better than mr beast  i will sub to you in solidarity
its sad because mr beast was trying to help piediepie stay  1
i surprised mr beast did not reply this video
tagit  ver och sprungit iv g med 35 miljoners f rspr ng  mer  n 3 sverige tillsammans   men felix r r ju knappt sina pengar i j mf relse  s  win till hans f rm n  sn lj p mot dem som f der han ha ha 
its crazy how now days mrbeast has 146m subscribers and pewdiepie has 111m 
mr beast                            
great review   i d like to hear your opinion on st thomas aquinas s the summa theologica  arguably one of the most important works in european history and philosophy 
hey read the al quran pewds
my firend you will allways will be the nr 1 youtuber and the youtuber
he going to god
no  continue to minecraft and very good m s mejor  
merak etme kral sen her zaman youtube nin en iyisi olucaks n
now mrbeast will pass t series
in you are dreams 
  ayushgoyal  nor t series will pass mr beast
 ayushgoyal  the sub gap is closing  146m to 240m  it can be done
  ayushgoyal  in your dreams  mrbeast is growing faster than t series  he is definitely going to overtake them
 ayushgoyal  indian
 ayushgoyal  cope  it will happen someday if mrbeast keeps up this pace 
 spawnerist6241 243m to 156m now lol
go  sub to pewds  return him to the crown 
i like that video too love you too much
the video is can i cy the picture i love some baby love you too
mr beast vs t series  the final youtube war
i have never heard of t series until now  
your channel videos view s is like indian 2million subscriber s channel       
even if i don t watch your vids a bunch i would choose you because mr beast is having too much drama
i like pew die pie so please guys sub to pew die pie
to think that mr beast a few years ago was doing what ever he could to support pews in the war against t series is crazy  we all knew beast was going to pass him up because mr beast is a down to earth dude but pews passing the torch is amaizng
no matter what  pewdiepie will always remain as the best youtuber 
you want to get rid of him by taking the joke he made seriously now because you will never pass him again because you used to think he could not pass you but he passed and now you are so desperate to ask him to delete your channel as you beg you are nothing else you are just a fool
this is truly a master speaking to his student proud for him being surpassed also i never knew pewdiepie was so into philosophy  it s pretty cool
he also spoke about science somewhere in the video  about that  felix said like many people that science is actually boring  sterile in other words  while it is true that scientists have to make observations without any biases  there are still scientists who believe science does not necessarily kill the  wonder  of our world  but actually add more wonder  understanding about the world makes the world more exciting and awe inducing  it is all a matter of perspective  you can look at the sun and say it is a boring ball of gas but you can also say that the sun and all stars are a delicate balance between gravity and pressure inside the star 
read quran the holy book your concept will be clear after that   
another war i see i think the beast will win be careful pewdiepie     
i love your videos
he hasn t gained 1m subs in 3 months while mrbeast gaining 2m in 12 days
felix   jimmy  more jimmy are literally flying the flag for youtube creators from the 2010s   before  gg to them both for still going strong  
i still do not understand why pew die pie has not gotten a single sub since 2021
 
damn this video was hella boring lol
your getting boring that is why he passed you you cannot even move from111m subs just facts 
yup
thanks for all your videos  pewdiedie  congratulations mrbeast
anyone who is not subscribed do it now  
you were like a father to me felix
felix  read crime and punishment 
so why your subscribe are so slow  
who is patient  hopefully later your subs can also be richer like mrbeast
sore loser 
i am an indian but pewds>t series
gamer pewds to philosopher pewds
mr personality here  how you have so many subs i will never understand 
00 00 pewdiepie  mrbeast has taken over me and subscribers
nice    
for a person who like philosophy it is amazing that he got the girl that is contradictory to philosophy  
you should read kierkegaard 
stoism can help  but mostly is is a suppressor of what makes you human 
i think craving is equal to evolving  we suffer and then we invent something  in order to not suffer  so your logic sucks  
love how i can confidently say i ve been subscribed to mrbeast before he even hit a mil  i remember when the original count to 100 000 video came out
try out the bible its a wonderful book bro  you will love it 
pewds is literally my good mood  was having a hard time  thanks pood
pewdiepie swears to much
cry 
soft 
we love you pewdiepie
no we lost
you should explore jainism  since you have already read about buddhism 
try reading jainsim  it is the father religion of buddhism and details all the concepts of life
absolutely true  jainism is the best
are you indian
religion is shared delusion
never you bruh piedewpie mrbeast will never delete his channel
pewdiepie forever 
well i kind of stopped watching you a few years ago not cus of the contravercy stuff just cus i did not really care for the content you was making as much as back when i was still in collage  so to be honest i did not even know he overtook you till now cus i was not keeping an eye on your sub count and honestly thought you had more than 111mill   think you will always be a youtube legend but kind of happy that it was mr beast that overtook you  like every single one of his videos is amazing and it kind of has that feel of clasic youtube of people just doing random creative things but to a more insane level   and ill be honest i think gaming channels are kind of been there done that now like ill still enjoy markaplier and jacksepticeye and a few others but we really needed something diffrent like mr beast to be on top 
i thought he retired
we love you always thanks for being here for us
t series      
in all technicality pewdiepie is a solo youtuber mrbeast however has multiple people who need to be there for the video to do good so in all sense the true solo king is pewds forever bros
mrbeast is a company
 drkpmnair that is what i said
i know you do not read comments but i appreciate a lot the book recs  i notice we like the same stuff sooo
you got 111m mrbeast has l38
psvr2 will end my suffering  true story 
we need you to review the bible
there are 2 genders on the world  no place for homosexuals  i tald them the damnedests
update yourself to the best  in your content  in your behavior  be useful for all person on the world  these are the roles to be a good famous person  tell me what is the point of being famous does not benefit others i ask that you be a useful person  not a beneficiary if you  doing these you will be famous in this world and after leaving this world
lier you do  you dissed t series for passing you and used the b word
you are too young for this lol
ok kid  
bro is too young to watch bitch lasa a
this is just a thought but what if pewds and mrbeast did a collab ik pewdiepie is in japan and mrbeast in north carolina its not real and they do not have to do it at all but would not that be cool 
 good or bad does not exist   thinks about all the true crime podcasts i have listened to about serial killers  then what is ted bundy  john wayne gacy   0  they seems pretty bad to me  someone please enlighten my stupid brain
did not they have mental illnesses  or grew up with awful childhoods 
after 3 months he have same subscribers  
because he said he is retired from yt  he does not upload the same as he did years ago 
you read so many books why do not you read quran
because he is not religious  stop trying to force your religion on people 
 spawnerist6241 no one s forcing anything on anyone brother it is a suggestion also he red buddha s words it is a religious book so why not give it a try huh  i encourage you too in fact from your text you seem annoyed from it so why do not you try it go on read it before judging it and try to keep an open mind while reading it just like any other book thanks
because it promotes terrorism
y all need to meet in person
revisit infamous second son

already retired from youtube as  1  at this point pewdiepie is doing youtube for fun  always my  1 <3
mrbeast if you are reading this comment pass t series for the king
tru
pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  a gamer  a news presenter  a  gym bro  a philosopher  basically an older brother we have never met but became a  significant part of our lives 
yep  he s had a good run 
bro thought he could get away with copying the most liked comment posted 2 months ago
if y all think about it it s good news  jimmy can avenge pewdiepie by passing t series
t series dosent count its a corporation  
what a nice young gentlemen  hopefully he doesn t say the n word
dude this shit happened years ago  get out of here
damn                   
if you have guts now make roast videos  like you did on indians during t series fiasco 
cheap internet get out of here
read the holy quran
he is not religious 
you are forgetten youtuber
you should quit
you are still the best entertainer ever  i do not watch your content much these days  but i watched you a lot when i was younger  you made me laugh and you made me happy  you were a friend  while i did not have any 
i am from india did not subscribed mr beast neither t series but you are different man 
pewdiepie you are my childhood
mr beast is high subs than pewdiepie
                    
well it is not comparable  their content is so different  mrbeast was so obsessed with pewdiepie he did everything to get to his level  sadly  pewdiepie is retired but i am glad he is still here making videos  he is legendary 
                   
mr beast is the devils
if pewdiepie is bad then t series is dad    
dead 
travis head india s dad
 blazer9547 ipl can buy 100 of travis head and all aus player in single bid
 
mr beast used to be his fan now he passed him but they are still bros
mrbeast started the subscribe to pewdiepie trend  of coruse they are still bros
you are still number 1 to me and a lot of people  fuck mr beast 
mrbeast started the subscribe to pewdiepie trend 
mr beast is father of pewdiepie
when pewds talks about philosophy it is sort of like mommy blogging except instead of a kid  it is his sense of personal discovery that he is awkwardly asking everyone to smile at
can you do a book review on the quran 
why is he asking for subs even though he has 111m
 t e x t  o n  t e l e g r a m   pewdiepie58 uhhhh what 
 externalaffersair it s a scam and just ignore it
 zockerstats ok thanks for that
mrbeast literally has his banner and about section as  sub for a cookie 
 spawnerist6241 yes lol  now why is mrbeast asking for subs
 externalaffersair because they can do that  you do not lose the ability to be able to ask people to subscribe to you after you past 100m
 externalaffersair t series also  despite being the most subscribed youtube channel  also asks for people to subscribe in the description of there videos 
 spawnerist6241 bro i just sent a simple message you are getting mad for no reason
 externalaffersair i am not getting mad though  i responded
 spawnerist6241 k if you play roblox try the game roblox wild west  its by far the best also watch a vid on how to play
subscribe to pewdiepie 
mr beast vs pewdiepie
pewdiepie and mrbeast not the enemy because i support him to be bestfriend         i am slay in anywhere
the student has become the master
it is actually fitting that one of his biggest fans surpassed him
you will always be the king
this is the fruit of your karma itself you should be done the same thing everytime i wish your subscribers count rate slow down and their are many more indian channels who will also surpass you pewdcke 
one of the greatest  swami vivekananda
live life good  don t live forever bad   buddhism
do you have more subscribers than mrbeast  mrbeast has more subscribers than you ll see in the videos you have saved you have ghost subscribers 
youtube career is like life style  but hating someone that better than you  ok i was thinking why i writing it  if i did not watched full video 
read some islamic books you might learn a thing or two
horses fly       
 xxsomeguyxx the time we live in is magical if you asked people 100 years ago and that is just man made stuff  imagine what the creator of the universe can do 
he is not religious 
 spawnerist6241 so 
do not forget  mrbeast is a commercial youtuber  it is normal he will get more subscribers easily and mrbeast are not jimmy  it is a team there is chris  carl  chandler  etc  but you did it by yourself pewds  that is why you are the  1 youtuber in the world
mr beast do good to people he is nice guy  you are good maybe but you do nothing with your influence like nothing at all
it s been a month pewds
could someone recommend any philosophy books for beginners  or can i just start with any book

nicw books though ill check few
12 minutes talking about philosophy and 5 seconds talking about mr beast in the end  
it is
i do not watch pewdiepie that much anymore because i enjoy gaming content the most but i still support him  he was a large part of my life growing up  a living legend among youtube creators
thank you for visiting my channel
anger is a usefull emotion
i may not watch your content as much these days  but you are still my favourite youtuber 
beast all the way
why are you not subscribing to pewdiepie
hello
future he will not be in the 50 channel list
he will 
subscribe to pewdiepie to get him hit 200m subs and beat t series
0 37 sounds like  buttism   
read bhagwat geeta  
mr  beast is a concoction  you are the real organic deal 
>  leta goooooooooo but no offense
nothing to again some 112m subscribers of pewdiepie
fun fact  if mr beast keeps growing at the same rate  he will have hit 1 billion subs in less than 5 years time 
ahhhh a dying star is still a star  until it explodes  jokes  we still love you and always will  this is just how time works  it was inevitable  stay humble  stay cool  you still helped me in some of my darkest moments and all from the comfortable of your limited edition swivle down bed chair 
well even without looking at what beast is doing and what you are doing you have litterly like every other youtuber nothing special while beast is spending millions on his vids on people that are blind on people that just need the money with cool challanges
nice to see epictetus getting a shout out  great summation of stoicism 
dang mrbeast aready with 132 million subscribers and you are still with 111 million
t series still has the throne
it is like what the rabbis told us that  jews have more teeths than goyims    so stupid
maybe this wife had not any teeth
pewdiepie will forever be the  1 youtuber to an entire generation   the first  youtube kids  literally grew up with him  he does not know me  never will  but i genuinely consider him a friend   and congrats to jimmy  he deserves everything he is got  and i honestly cannot think of anyone more worthy of carrying the torch

read the bible 
bible is for warmongers
the moment you realise mr beast did not leave a comment in this video
pewds does everything 
i don t hate mr  beast but i think he stopped being a content creator long ago and ultimately became a brand  a corporation  pewdiepie is just one dude making videos from his home 
senin nas l 111 milyol abonen var lo

111 m not bad for a hotdog man
happiness is your own value though  or happiness can have your own definition  there s way more to happiness with time as a factor  cannot believe you read that though  it s  master program book 
pewdiepie s 1st
regarding anger for me  it is a useful tool but you have to have it under control and  enclosed  something like fire  i presonally do not get angry nor mad and if i do it is used as a tool to get attention  respect or dominance  because i tend to be a leader so getting a little angry from time to time is useful but if you are angry a lot or all the time  your anger becomes a vulnerability and other people act according to that  that is why angry choleric people seem funny to us 
pewdiepie  why have not you read the book filled with the most wisdom  the bible 
does mr beast grow with his audience like pewds  does he have longevity 
goat
s ubs   
you should give a coronation just like how smosh gave you
vaybe ke ke  ok azimli olsan mr beast  gece edin
i was watching mr beast and saw his sub number and then wondered how many you have and if he had already surpassed you so this is why i looked up your channel and came to this video  um 
i wish felix realized that most of his fans love these videos and i hope he makes longer ones in this format  
remember when fred was the first to 1 mil then smosh became the most subscribed then pewdiepie beat them and now  ignoring t series and all that  mr beast has taken the spot
mr beast maybe has been take everything for you but still he cannot took the legend from you  you are my teenager memory i remember always watching your videos and laugh it and i am sure people here also same
if you want those books let me know
   
i am sub
pewdiepie vs t series   i lost but still i am the top solo creator  pewdiepie vs mr  beast    
bro gang always rocks you were always my favorited you tuber    
hmmm sweet suffering  but how did it come to this
all hearts to you  felix 
why did you quit youtube 
he did not quit
129mln subs mr beast
we we dielive
don t worry pewdiepie  you can always make great videos that get a lot of views you suddenly might get a boost that makes you pass other channels so keep going and i  am a mrbeast fan but you can suddently get more subs you re channel will never be forgotten
   
hehe mrbeast is 130m
sooo
 oihrui yeahhhhhhhu 
ahhhahahahahaha love that line  i do not care about subs  after his too biggest videos were about subs
honestly pewds had one of the strongest runs on youtube he held the title of most subscribere for like 8 years just playing games reading reddit and some challenges so its not about the end of the journey its how he got here
actually your real subs 70 million
no
actually mr beast it better than pewdiepie  
mr beast s content is straight cringe 
    mrbeast                                                                                                                                     pewdiepie                                                                                                        
wow
pewdiepie is god
try reading quran
that s more andrew tates kind of book
forget pali canon   read the lotus sutra the transient teaching of old buddhism were expedient means   the lotus sutra is the true teaching 
every king will lose his crown one day 
what are you saying  i almost understand you    
la mayor parte de suscriptores de mr beast son latinos xd
i have 129 subs  and i have no idea why  because i have never uploaded a single video  i do not want to imagine how it feels to have 111 million subs  all watching you and expecting a lot from what you say  so for all of that  thanks for talking about philosophy and history  it was a good tea break moment 
bullshit he is salty af mr beast surpassed him lol  both youtubers are getting paid millions to provide shit content inspiring millions of kids that now think  hey  if i just upload me doing a bunch of dumb shit no value  on youtube i can be rich  what a great message we send to kids do dumb shit and get rewarded for it  society is getting worse and worse because of hollow influencers that spew out hollow bs  then their deluded followers think their favorite influencer is sooooo smaaaart and wise all because they laughed as they watched them play video games and do dumb shit  what a world lol
flop
your hatred for people will one let you down if you want to go up respect other  you cannot win by suppressing other 
what if aristotles wife told him that because she was missing teeth and did not want him to know
well at least mr beast will defeat t series for you 
felix is still the king of youtube no matter what 
pewds didn t let fame get to his head  let that sink in instead of calling him boring lol
a man it is okay i your still the greatest youtuber ever is just mrbeast is making some challenges video s on youtube that is so much popular
wtf look at his subscribers 111m
your videos always bring a smile to my face and make my day
you will hit 112m sub
pewds you got to play spelunky it is almost impossible to beat and it would be such entertaining game play you would get pissed lol
nice bridge
nig 
i m so happy you said buddism first i spent 11 months understanding and practicing the eight fold path
             
happy wheeels
bro say hi to your father t series   
good makes better content
s ubs
i am a high school student going into 9th grade  in the 12th grade  i will live in a separate house and i do not want to be a burden to my family  even if there are 3 4 of these people  it would be great  it is enough to leave 1 subscriber for me to grow my channel until the 12th grade  thank you very much in advance  i always point this out  be sure that you will receive the return of your unique friendship and you will meet this favor one day  take care of yourself 
fun fact  you s   paper  money is not made of paper  it is made of 75  cotton and 25  linen  that being said  i grabbed a few bills and held them up in front of my window  indirect late afternoon light  you can see through them so much that you see both the image printed on the front and the image on the back  reversed  of course  so you are correct in calling them out  they look super fake in the artwork because all you see is the image from the  front  side  furthermore  it looks like they are all displaying the front side  and if they were actually  fluttering around  you would get a mix of front  back  rightside up  upside down  etc   with both sides showing through each other as appropriate to orientation and lighting  wow     money is more difficult to comp than you would think  is it not 
thank you for being the person you are  knowing the fact that you are among the top content creators on youtube returned my faith in humanity 
you are boring
ratio
uhh actually mr beast it more funny  and pewdiepie is just boring                                                        
mrbeast passed you by a lot pewdiepie you know he has 130 million subscribers
i love this type of video by pewdiepie  i d definitely watch self development and philosophy videos by him if he made more of those 
omg  what a sad standards are we allowing into our minds  if plato and socrates read that or watched the nonsense philosopher you said  i better get to a mirror and slap myself maybe i wake up 
jordan peterson is a good  relatively easy way into philosophy 
if you think these books are good  you should read the bible and the book of proverbs  also  the gospels start with the gospel of john
you should read the yoga sutras of patanjali
sometimes i wonder how many of your subs are gone from the earth and when is it my turn  that is how far you have come i do not watch your content but i remained subbed simply because you were a huge part of my high school years
mrbeast  jimmy  vs pewdiepie
i am better than pewdiepie snd mrbeast
 strong devil best kids can kill you best demon kid     
 oihrui shut up i am better than you
 superadrenalinegaming ok blow up earth then
if mr beast would have been the one to overtake him in the first place i would have been much more understanding  a hardworking creator who makes his own content  as opposed to a big company who just upload 
pewbs please pin this comment to the top because of the following truths in it  we all know youtube froze pewdiepie s ability to get new subscribers a few years ago   right now as i type  you pewbs should be easily at well over 200 million subs   i checked your sub count on your social blade page the last few years and it has said zero new subs and even your views count seems to have been messed with for the last 2 or 3 years   yet  youtube thinks we are stupid and do not realize it   that is their way to steal money from youtubers so they do not have to pay us by literally not counting millions of views and comments   the new thing with youtube is that they made the thumbs up button disappear   youtube has been on a power trip for years and their employees come up with all kinds of foul ideas to take away from us while benefiting themselves   meanwhile we are the ones creating the billions of hours of content to make youtube richer   that is the way of the american selfish companies that give you the crappiest product and or services while taking the most from us   the greed is obvious on youtube s side   but  we pubers will always know and recognize pewbs as the true king of subscribers in the history of youtube   pewbs has over twenty nine billion views and over a hundred eleven million subscribers as of january 2023 and youtube will never ever take that away from him      long live the king  the pewbs pewdiepie     i got to go now to take a sh t  i have been holding in   i hope i make it to the bathroom   help me oprah winfrey make it in time to my royal porcelain so i will not crap my pants   
bro you are so boring right now  i fear if i had endless money i would be this boring as well
uhh basically mr beast it better because he have more money than pewdiepie  and pewdiepie is boring because he have less money than mr beast                                                  
pewdiepie will always be number 1 to millions of people but alas the end of era is here and the beggining of a new era is upon us the mrbeast era rip king pewdiepie 2010 2022
the four agreements and i am glad that you have not stopped making videos like a lot of youtubers who get some money then leave and try to come back when the money are not looking too good
i think i speak for everyone when i say that you should have done happy wheels two hundred 
you are still number one most subscribers
he is officially almost 20 million subs behind
hey man at least you made it to the impossible or what people think they will never achieve
soon justin hawkins will do the same  juuuuuustin hawkins riiides againnn    againnnnn   
this pewd sounds so much informative  now even the 60 years olds will watch him
mrbeast is more of a kids channel anyways so its obious why he has so many subs
hater
 suyashagrawal1102 how does that make me a hater  just proving facts literally said nothing about me hating mrbeast  god people are stupid lol
we we dielive
it sad that pewdiepie did not win the sub war
at least you do not have to buy and  bribe your subscribers 
      
were dead
hi felix  i really want to hear your review on the quran 
my favourite is t series
bot subs
mrbeast may have passed pewdiepie in subs  but pewdiepie will always be the original king of youtube 
give me some month and i ll pass you too 
mysterious farts in the sky 
pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  a gamer  a news presenter  a gym bro  a philosopher  basically an older brother we have never met but became a significant part of our lives 
pewdiepie is an old school channel
nah mr beast is just the best
mr beast >pewd ep e 
pewdiepie    mr beast  
 sewerynrozanski8319 piwdiepie   
i just believe your going to have youtubers pass you over the years 
pin me right now
jo mama
interesting thing about dying is that one of life s biggest objetive is to self preserve  all living things are kind of unnatural in that sense  since that is basically fighting against entropy  even though i see the problems with fear as stoicism describes  i personally see death as a disease that should be cured  since i am already as unnatural as any other human in modern society  i do not see a contradiction 
you cannot do that  you cannot delete mrbeast channel 
ofcrse you care about subs bro  look at you are face   ofcrse you do 
hey i see you are not getting to many views these days  how i doing man 
mr  beast better pewdiepie

i am turkish      
i was shocked because i thought you had the most out of anyone on here   you re still winning so who cares 
11 million in like 3 years from someone like you is just  you fell off   pewdiepie right now fr   
thank you for 3 42 somehow never saw that quote very legendary 
felix learn how to play guitar  its right there for you  guitar review  heavy metal is waiting for you
pewdiepie is just sleeping viking 
jake the viking
mr beast was you are fan
this is the most chaotic way i have ever seen to describe buddhism philosphy
it is hard to believe but you have to believe it what ever you do you cannot beat him
 
are you still competing with t series     
stfu t series sucks
 papyruslover2763 yeh and this guy had to suck in return    
 madhukulya rajput who the fuck cares  pewdiepie has over 100 million subs anyway 
 papyruslover2763 he cares   have not you heard the poorly composed song by him   to troll t series  look how karma hits    
 madhukulya rajput atleast pediepies song was original unlike t series
 theblackwhiteasian that is good   he was acting as a child previously  not knowing that evey life has different path all are going towards their destiny
genuine authentic freedom > absolute freedom  joy > happiness  some things are objectively true and knowable about the universe therefore good and evil do exist even based on your comment that the heros journey is meaningless without the villain
                                                                                      
i remember when mrbeast was helping you past t series and now he is passed you  fair play mrbeast
never make war against indian you tube channels otherwise   
 act4infiniterotation yup as person they are better but if they got into the subscribers race  the whole case will reverse completely
 mrdg05 mrbeast is gaining more suscribers than t series  if he keeps that pace of new suscribers  most likely in about a year mrbeast will surpass t series 
 realtime01694 that is what i want he is a good guy he deserves but a racist content can reverse the whole acronym
 mrdg05only about a 16mil sub gap and jimmy is still growing faster than tseries
 nottelling ib7dblet him grow pls do not pull out any controversy otherwise 
 nottelling ib7dbonly 14 m now
  mrdg05 he will pass t series soon
vive mr beast
no sbucrice
book review let s go
why is the  most replayed  in the end of the video  that is just sad 
mrbeast and pewdiepie >>>>>> mrbeast vs pewdiepie

jealous
why is a swedish man in japan with a korean gps  xd
i do not think anyone cares about you dude loloool
he passed your views years ago 
 maldingo mr feast 
these book choices were somewhat  surprising
mr beast does not seek to overtake you  he just does what he wants
i mean  of all the kind of people to have passed on the torch to  you could not have picked a better guy 
you don t like
at least mr beasts subscriber to viewer ratio does not make me suspicious that a majority of the subs are bots   used to love pewdiepie but he is kind of arrogant and definitely the type to have fake subscribers to maintain a title 
you deserve  
i would recommend to read c s  lewis  he is brilliant 
deserved
ups  100mil youtuber recommend books  o i feel emotional  cuz of happiness  thank you felix 
mr beast already at 127m now
lol pewds  mrbeast deserved more subs than you  i mean  just look at his content

shitheads who compare mr beast to pewdiepie

mr beast is a nice guy and what not but fuck him pewds is and always will be  1  its like the sears tower in chicago being changed to willis tower  everyone knows the real deal 
did you start reading these books after you tried to copy some mr beast s ideas which did not work    or before     you have too much rage and ego inside you to just let go   ooling these kids that follow you is the wrong thing to do
t series
i am you from a parallel universe  i have come to tell you about your future  it s going to be awesome   bro fist  you might think you ve experienced everything  but you haven t  so shut up and wait 
you are messi and mr beast is cr7 of youtube universe  you will  always be the goat

no c ingl s  pero te admiro  
ehhhh what is going on  is pewdiepie ok   i do not recognize him
11 56 i thought they were friends
pewdiepie is founding fathers of yt  regardless if others got more subs now  pewds will always be legendary  i do not even know mr beast lol  
it really does feel like a passing of the crown
do you even do anything now  not seen playing any games just reacting
the real subscribe war ends in 3years ago 
w
you will always remain a legend
it took a guy who is known for giving away millions of dollars to his subscribers to  dethrone  the goat  pewdiepie is still the best in my book 
thank you kelly clarkson  i get it now 
and t series has double the subs  where s the lasagna 
mr beast buys his subs
the quicker you re here  the faster you go    we all grew up watching you pewds  you will always have us fans here for you  
i can see that mrbeast is a paytowinner 
love how i got an ad discussing women power as felix was making a joke about it
bitch lasagna 2
mr beast became the evil he wanted to defeat  t series   lmao he is is not a youtuber now he is a company
best bait and switch lol
i d love to hear pewd s take on aquinus  augustine    cs lewis  work
wait so that book from adventure time is actually a real book  now you have got my attention
seek jesus
to simplify everything that is in every book  have no desire manage expectations   happiness  reality   expectations   i am currently practicing that right now 
bro mr beast is way better than you
i feel cool when pewdiepie review da book i already have   i happey
is pewd retired now  and he is giving reviews and insights in existentialism philosophies now    lol  those will blow your mind 
now mrbeast has 126 million subsss
127 million
he has 15 million more subscribers  than pewdiepie as of  6 30 utc 06 01 23 
mrbeast god gente siuuuuuuu ehh messi pe oe
pewdiepie you will always be a legend for us 
mrbeast broke pewdie
 
hope he will pass t series and cocomelon
 mrbeast  just see this
hope they both always be on good terms   
how can this guy can entertain people with his childish character
mr beast did pay to win
when he read plato he did not understand the antique meaning of the word virtue  now he is a bit closer  he has to read a bit more  god damn this guy is slow 
si
lol
pewdiepie read my book 
 ugh 
tseries vs mrbeast
 t series  233m     mrbeast 127m   
if you do not care why are you planning a collab  with mr beast and netflix  and jake paul will play pewdiepie on your autobiography story as the main character   youtubers  who went famous review  on netflix dou
i am ngl i love mr beast and all  but pewds did this all on his own and held the title of the most subscribed individual for almost a whole decade  you could still say the same today since mr beast seems to be a group channel kind of  but anyway all i am saying is pewd s record will be hard to beat for any youtuber who knows if it will ever be beat again
your still an king
i do not watch peweiepie much  but his channel has a community with him because he sticks uploading and to the content people like  so even though hes not reaching new people he is keeping the community that he alr has 
even mrbeast take over pewdiepie  they are still both friends  
i love this format because it always teaches me something about life which makes me feel good and calms me down  and it is funny too because it is felix telling us the content  d
book review  ingenious 
we are no strangers to love you know the rules and so do i  do i  a full commitment s what i am thinking of you would not get this from any other guy i just want to tell you how i am feeling got to make you understand never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you we have known each other for so long your heart s been aching  but you are too shy to say it  say it  inside  we both know what is been going on  going on  we know the game and we are going to play it and if you ask me how i am feeling do not tell me you are too blind to see never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you we have known each other for so long your heart s been aching  but you are too shy to say it  to say it  inside  we both know what is been going on  going on  we know the game and we are going to play it i just want to tell you how i am feeling got to make you understand never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you never going to give you up never going to let you down never going to run around and desert you never going to make you cry never going to say goodbye never going to tell a lie and hurt you
crazy to see how much of a fan mrbeast was  to absolutely surpassing his sub goal  reaching his dream goal  and being noticed by literally every yt creator  what an inspiration  
seneca gang
i m unsubscribing to mr beast for you pewdipie
atleast you are the most subbed gamer
i m glad pewdiepie is not salty about the hole thing cuz normally people who are at the top like to stay at the top also pewdiepie should do a challenge with mr beast
1st  t series   2nd  mrbeast   3rd  pewdiepie   
1st t series 2nd coco melon 3rd set 4th mr beast 5th pedipi
after you practice virtue for long enough  you will come to disdain the absence of it  you will disdain the bugmen  those without values  the tiktok watching p hubbers who get their dismal ethics from superhero movies or msm
bhikkhu bodhi collection is wonderful  i have heard of that book  i ve had a copy for years
last time i watched mr beast he had 8 mill followers  
f
time watching mr beast is winner
have not watched you in a while but this is great i did not know you were a philosopher you should use your audience to help with this philosophy is the way to happiness and freedom  people may not think of freedom or happiness in the way it actually is but philosophy helps you clarify your own thoughts and make you feel better about yourself and hence helping people make a better world for themselves and others 
hey pewds invite you to study islam and philosophy metaphysics and logic 
man is sad to see him retire but he seems hella happy in his life i been watching you since i was 8 now i am 15 man time passed by fast and now mr beast has finally surpassed hid master i am happy for him but man hope you have a good life till the end
who are you 
because you are content suck for 3 years old
11 59
your subs are the smart ones  
try to learn quran
delete your channel as promised  you have 24 hours   
shame on you
l
subscriber 111m view 3m   
mrbest
you should add different country soundtracks like mr beast did  because that makes it easier for me 
mrb sucks  alot of his videos are just the same last to take off hand or stay in a circle bullsht
how did this dude even get so many subs and famous  like what did he do 
mr beast you cheated on pewdiepie
what time is it   edit  i gave a bit of a scroll down through the comments but i am surprised i did not see a adventure time comment
ab mr beast ko diss kar
nothing is better than the words of allah 
we lost  better luck next time
nor mr beast passed cocomelon in subs
hehehheh
even if mr beast forever had less subs than you  he would forever posses one thing that would bring his nearly above yours better camera quality
l   racio
mrs  beast all the way  <3 he does not just shit talk people to get views  like pew  sorry but beast is an angel compared to you 
and mr beast is still growing  <3
yea you should have done happy wheels lol
if not yet done  you should check seneca s work  de brevitate vitae   on the basis of your reviews  you would really like it 
after pewds move to japan my point of youtube already change back to the old days just enjoying what content i want with smiles
      
oui oui dielife
you can still do happy wheels 200       
we cannot do anything pewdieeee we just need to take me beast to passed subs on t series
i think with 111 millions subs for one person your set for life 
would love book reviews on hesse books  especially narcissus and goldmund and steppenwolf  highly recommend
we want classic pewdiepie  
it is crazy i remember watching mrbeast when we had less than 50k subs  and pewdiepie was just chillin and now mrbeast overtook him in no time
i do not know how people even watch pew die pie bro i tried watching this man bro i was not entertained    
i find his minecraft and terreria series entertaining
you are not growing your subscribers   
make some roblox video
this guy is annoying asf  i do not see what skill or telant he possesses  its no wonder he was passed up 
these book review videos are the best 
he passed me too
at least make mrbeast pass t series for you felix
the dis track for mr beast must be  beast lasagna 
        
hhahahaha mr beast is better than you noooob
you mean he is better than your dead channel
wtf  he has 13 years of youtube
mr beast is for literal 3year olds with mommas phone  he is also no no no
moooore books  i love it 
what do you do you that is so meaniful compared to mrbeast  nada
 and one day he read christ the eternal tao and was never the same again 
book review woooorr                   
all the phases pewds went through   the sweet innocent phase  the edgy phase  the alcoholic phase  the gym bro phase  the gamerbio phase  the philosopher phase
 the stolen comment phase
 mrman9333 you forgot to like my comment
 crazysilly2914 alright i liked it > 
 mrman9333 thanks buddy it really helps out  
 crazysilly2914  
l
love you both felic as always
i will take pewds over beast anytime  it is not that i do not like mr  beast  i just do not like the standards that became because of his growth  every other youtuber   video now is literally cookie cutter copy cat of his  in your face intense music non stop action for a  watch time  videos  and the algorithm awards this  youtube started and grew in the beginning because people could be themselves   have personality  pewds vids still bring back nostalgia youtube vibes and kudos to him for keeping it real all these years 
hi
same honestly  like pewds will always be the og
why do people write paragraphs as comments these days
 jmoggieesome people put thought into their comments
same
i agree
pewdiepie are sooooo 2010 
try reading the quran
happy wheels 200 would be great
mr beast have voice translate
bayar
muach piza
mami alat
help mie
waste piwdiepie
i miss edgy pewdiepie  that time was wild  
i never got this  this channel has nothing content but from a pretentious man child  at least jimmy does something 
mr beasts content is for everybody  he is always switching up his content   goes big  pewdiepie s content is for a certain age group mainly  a lot of his fans grew up   there are many channels like him  he is the first goat of youtube but he will never get close to the top ever again 
 pretentious man child  talking about yourself 
we love ya pewds your the true og king of youtube   
try to give away your millions as he does with his  you can surpass him again hahaha
love how he is promoting these healthy habits to his fanbase from   genuine care and interest and not under the guise of wanting financial gain  happy to be able to grow as a long time watcher starting from middle school  and have the content grow as well alongside me as i am in university 
mr beast is a company that gain sub through spending absurd amount of money to do absurd things that we normal people cannot do  how interesting  everybody can do that with that kind of money and replace him  pewdiepie gains sub through talking about gaming and life by himself 
pewdiepie is not the good youtuber
what does not kill you makes you   more depressed  yay 
still a king of youtube
i like how this has nothing to do with mr beast  
all american youtube community          
yes
in an alternate timeline  this video would be named  tobuscus passed me in s ubs   
but mr beast has not gone through cocomelons 150mil subscribers
  
kamu nanya like
really cool  i will try epictitus and the mathematical universe one
s ub
watched you since i was 12  i am 23 now its wild thank you for the laughs pewwds your a legend barrrelll
still  1 
maybe you should read into imam alghazali and rumi  their books are life changing  in a good way  of course 
your title is messed up
he took 7 years and it took you 10  years
like he said  he doesn t care  
it s misleading to say buddha said life is suffering  the word  suffering  comes from a translation of the word  dukkha   but it this context it is probably better translated as  unsatisfactoriness   you re not necessarily suffering when craving for things  although you could be  but you re always unsatisfied 
are you still going to do happy wheels pt 2
now he has 14 millino more subscribers than you
jeez imagine falling for a bullshit eastern religion 
fym  bullshit easter religion 
 rimarkwick4057 i mean exactly that  it s a bullshit fake religion  it says nice things  but if you preach love and and forgiveness without christ  then it doesn t really do you any good 
 corneliusbogfrollupfitzgerald i could say the same thing about christianity  i think it s all a load of bullshit  however i don t say that because it s rude 
i knew this would happen
are you budhhist  pewd  if yes  as indian i forgive you for everything about t series vs pew shit  
your videos are getting very boring   you do not deserve  this  
i always thought philosophy was kind of filled with egotistical people who think that they are better than everyone else  but i really do enjoy listening to pewds talk about all the different outlooks on life
every person on the planet should subscribe to pewdipie
buddhism ancient anarchists like the stoics and cynics democracy the printing press internet  christianity  are you an assassin or a templar that is the question
didn t mr beast say he would delete his channel if he was about to pass pewdiepie
just subed
nice
piewdie pie is the example of a real youtube havn t increased in subs for years still uploads still tries his best to cheer and make his true audince happy respect for you piewdiepie
111 125
mr beast fully deserves it
again a company vs a dude if there weren t that much children and dumb blinded people he wouldn t have that much subs 
pp
loooool pewdiepie looks offended
technically felix is still the most subscribed person as mr beast is kind of like a production team now   could be wrong though
wow  unsubbed bro  i cannot believe i was subbed to someone with a lower sub rate than mr  beast bro
less energy video
why you are talking by using your nose    
there is always greater star wars  
i will never forget you are legacy
    
man i am really craving some water  but i must not drink 
do not worry pewdiepie mrbeast will beat t series
but is not mrbeast technically a company now   
 stickman6546 nah it isent
mrbeast is a smart guy  remember when he was helping pewdiepie beat t series in sub counts  putting up billboards and such  the guy was getting exposure while doing that  pretty smart  he is going to be the first billionaire on youtube according to forbes 
pewdiepie got them eras
mr beast will never hold title for most subbed channel
3 23 what machean ethics   
oof
i think it is better to read about islam
pewdipie is mr beasts idol
mr brest is pro studio  not a youtuber
pewdiepie is done  it s over  no 2022 rewind  so pewdiepie how will you retire  will you get a regular job  
then i am a hater of yiy
mr beast did not plan to pass your subs actually ngl 
mrbeast >>>>>> pewdiepie
all these people talking about pewds still being number 1 but i just want to say thank you for another book review  been wanting to get back into reading and this really helped 
remember when mrbeast looked up to pewdiepie 
mrbeast technically is not an individual creator anymore so pewds is still on top  it is still an amazing accomplishment though  so huge congratulations jimmy 
so why does he make well produced videos 
 kingbluexd wait  who makes well produced videos 
my philosophy   wax on wax off  words to live by 
book review series pls
wow it finally happened another youtuber took the lead for most subscribers
why is literally none of this about mrbeast 
because pewds does not care
omg yes  
he is on 125m
this is a video by someone with too much time on their hands 
this man running out of ideas     
or he is just doing things he loves now
happy new year pewdie
me checking in on the funny guy who screamed at barrels for a living  it has been 10 years  i wonder what horror game he is playing today 
damnnnnnn omg jimmy got higher subs
mr beast might have more subs king  but he was never in south park 
cool that you promoting stoicism
i hate when someone passes me in s ubs 
if you did not retire you would at least have 170m subs
mrbeast   
      
ah
you should make a pcg  that would be really cool
take that pewdiepie
he will take it because we do not care
he has mature alot do say he does not care bout subs anymore
watching first time about him
i do not know if you are taking recommendations  but i would highly suggest mere christianity by cs lewis  one of the most life changing books i have ever read 
i m watching this 2 weeks after he is at 130 mil now
en espa old wey
its ok dude you both on a high subs
ngk ngerti bhasa inggris wkwk
 
maybe mr beast was behind t series after all
just give it some time you will be the king again  by the way do happy wheels part 200
mr beast tried to help pewdiepie to beat t series a while back  man he bacame the one thing he swore to destroy
he just now noticeing this this happend like 3 months ago
he has 125m and you have 111m oof
i mean  who is better  mrbeast  or felix 
pewdiepie  why don t you do a 10 games a month as a game of the month type deal  you could help us fellow gamers know what the best things to get are 
go watch mrbeast
huh   how many months have you not been getting subscribers  mrbeast gained 24m subscribers in 4 months 
what do you call an alligator in a vest  an investigator

how bout the bible though
pewdiepie is the past mrbeast is the future 
he is better at making videos plus he helps people in need what is  your jimmy do  
for 111 million subs 5 mil views for each video is pretty bad
<33
mr beast>
112m
i do not understand the videos of this lady  i feel there is to much fog 
i like that pewds is trying something new
 
mrbeast is watched by a lot of people because it makes videos in english and in russian   but pewdipei does not
honestly  pewdiepie started like 5 years before mrbeast  that is like around 1500 days  with like at least 1k more videos  just way more goated 
mrbeast                                                                                 pewdipei

5 35 epic titus  
the problem with buddhism is that it goes against human nature  we have cravings because we are hunter gatherers  cravings ensured our survival  dissatisfaction gives us the ambition to overcome obstacles and improve our living conditions 
pewdiepie bad
i think the shame is you got 111m subs but views on 2 3 m  instead of subs race you should focus on 111m
nah
you are i nice person just know it in your heart 
 
az 
more important the view sub ratio on your side is   very   low   
i do not like your videos content
your videos are now kind of boring your old minecraft series were better
you been on 111 mill for 3 years       
what are you complaining about if the video does not even have subtitles in another language 
stop showing food please  
111 now 111 more you pewdiepie   
mr  beast does not stand a chance against pew news
no disrespect to the guy but his videos are not what they used to be i like the vlogs but there are so many good games out now that he can do playthroughs of 
you ll always be the best felix
really  you are not an iphone person 
jonieboi
watching this video while eating makes it more better and interesting
pls read homo deus from harari or humankind next  great books would recommend to everyone
pewdiepie is actually a very well read buffoon
i remember when mr beast helped and looked up to you now he is you 
kkkkk sim
10q felix
some could argue you our one of the  most prolific philosophers of our time w pewds
even there is a youtuber who has more subs than you  you are still the  1 king of youtuber
i am buddist
its kind of surprising that you got lot of subs there are lot of great channels which deserve more than you  however you got luck
it is called  charisma 
you were legend  for few years man
pewdiepie was my childhood youtuber since i was 5 years old now i am 17  mr breast i just discovered him last year eh 
using autocorrect may be dangerous lol breast 
bro has not gained at least 1 million subs in months
piewdiepie you are the best
every jew christian and muslim should unsub him now  he is inviting you guys to idol worshipping
just to be clear  it took him alot of money to get there  how much did it cost you  nothing
do not wary my subs is subs you
andrew tate ripoff breathe air sorry pew pew pieee
good on mr beast mr if its not my humour i do not like you
who want to pewdiepie play games    who want to old pewdiepie       tell pewdiepie we are  all want to old pewdiepie      
you will be always the number one forever felix 
disstrack coming  lmao would be funny  
 
i love love love book review  thank you  i have ordered 3 new audiobooks  
lol
very sad  
i know you will not see my comment but just in case  hire me so that i can translate all your videos for the ispana community  i will do it with all pleasure                     i will be your slave and i will be a good elf
you re looking healthy pewds
you both doing extraordinary  
do not watch this drunk 
read the bible next  bible book review
since you have read the buddhist scripture will you be reading the translated quran  just asking
i recommend you read the quran as it s philosophy and the mindset it develops are outstanding  the key human values i learned were self control and self respect  and how focusing on these individual betterments allows the building of a brilliant community  just overall improvement on life  not even from religious purpose  but reading it open minded to the faith religious is cool 
like many people  reading cheap books and running away from the bible 
mrbeast is better than your pewdiepie  mrbeast is getting better and it is good  famous and you will also be like mrbeast 
wtf is this video  he s clearly on drugs here
yes  mrbeast s videos are amazing and have a great production behind them  but  at least for me  he is not a youtuber  so yes  you are still the biggest youtuber 
you are the  burak oyunda  of global
pewdiepie is still the  1 youtuber and even with mr beast becoming the new  1 pewds is still the king you can t beat his legacy on this website 
you 111m subs  mrbeast 124m subs you   
first ytber i subbed to was mrbeast
the guy who wanted to help pewdiepie not get surpassed surpassed him
jimmy will make you number 1 again   both of you are true genuine selfless people
new guru with most subs you going to change life now bruh 
miracle of mindfulness is a good book on buddhism by thich nhath hanh
this is why i kept my hatred for mr  beast till now
let s do a new testament read along  that would be dope
an overrated youtube channel ever taken over by one of the best channels is not a bad thing at all 
more book reviews  and if possible  leave the ebooks in the description or get a audible sponser 
mrbeast looked up to pewdiepie  eventually he surpasses pewdiepie in subscribers 
the red book get deleted
if there is anyone who knows what is written in that gay science book tell me does it support or reject gay people cuz if he accepts the author is wrong
good i never liked this clown    mr beast is way better
mr beast helped pewdiepie in the sub war against t series and now he passes him  the betrayal  
difference of keeping and giving  
youtube would not b youtube without pewds let us be real bros
read the quran  book from god is the most worth reading
there was a time people unsubscribing t series for this man this man got subscribers more by luck that ended 
let us be honest  mrbeast have more subscribe  but mrbeast still see pewdiepie as his king
fyi  there is an iphone 14 
so if i do not want anything that mean i am not suffering 
oi mate  are you still friends with ssundee
yes
pewdiepie do not get more subs i am so sad this is really sad and he will be passed for all the youtubers pew i am sad
i got this book loves you as a birthday present when it first came out and it is been my prized possession ever since  
underrated sigma
thank you for being such a good role model for the world to see 
since this video  2 weeks ago  mr beast has gotten 16 million more subscribers  holy moly
while pewds here stuck at 111m since three years 
 everythingisawesome2903 a 1 year 
                    3    
mr beast will hit 200m before 2024
you barely make content anymore  not very surprising
i have never subscribed to either of you  but i am sure mr  beast is good sir who is going to play around big time for a while and revert somewhere whence he came  you  good felix  are huge part of the internet  one of it is definitions of times  mr  beast holds a piece of these times sure  but so do you like you have been for quite heck of a long time  to be fair and honest  who seriously cares to count and does the count even matter  by the end of day  you are both still filthy rich bitches with content enough to entertain us all for years to come  keep it up bro 
david lopez s  the story of buddhism  is great too and one of the few buddhist  summaries  that are fairly easy to digest  recent college gradute of history and religion  i would reccomend 
it is okay actually you get a lot of subs alone than mr beast
i think it s time to drop some marx and engels in the mix  would be a nice review
    
your still a legend pewds
why do you heated dharr mann
bro i love this guy 
                 
f
when this was uploaded mr beast had 115 subs 13 days later he has 123
to me good vidio     s you p e r vidio i am from indonesia     
this is the first interesting video i have seen from pdp  thank you  though i have not seen a lot  most video titles from him are quite uninteresting to me 
i am always a bit jealous of people that like felix can actually get into this type of reading  i am 100  positive i would fall asleep 5 minutes into any of these books to be honest xd i am a very casual reader and stuff that float my boat have to be fantasy   sci fi or at least have some kind of conspiracy to get me going  cannot get into stuff that resemble real life as that is what i am trying to escape in the first place 
but bro still has a classic vibes
 do not take my legs   you do not have any
you should read mahabharat by john d smith it is one of the greatest epic of indian mythology 
  
mrbeast looks like nwo manufactured poop  pewdiepew is so much more original 
mrbeast is the best
pewdiepie  more like pottypie 
taking t series name you gain 5m subs  
want to challenge t series again     
love you pewds  you will forever be the best
i remember the battle of t series a long time ago 
book reviews are the best videos 
don t worry pewdiepie  he s not as iconic as you man
no matter how much people passed you in subs you are always the 1 youtuber in bro s heart  actually even you stopped uploading people just going to enjoy your old videos lol 
no he is not lol
 uhm175 then you ain t a bro 
mrbeast went from saying pewdiepie 100k times to passing him in subs  
its prob a rave in sweden who wants you to go to it with oxygen in it  
very eye opening i want to read but i be get bored yes i break brains w words on purpose
iloveyou
you ended
pewdiepie pls come to bangladesh     
noob
it was very expected sorry
read the bhagavad gita
now he s going to surpass your country japan   he s too fast
pewds is from sweden 
not into any of those philosophy books but it is cool that he shares what he likes to read with us 
both channels are unique and brilliant in their own way 
the mr beast is best you
its not a mistake its a masterpiece
you don t care about in the future you be the lowest youtuber in history  
 
mr beast>
bu adam  izlemeye yasin dolmam   galiba
pewds is becoming beast and beast is becoming pewds
hopefully pewds will read quran someday and make a video about it  would be an interesting video  
enlightening pewds
overhyped channel
brother i think you have less subscribers than mrbeast why is his videos translating multiple languages  because youtube now automatically translates mrbeast s videos into multiple languages  but your videos do not have this feature  so youtube  for example  will automatically translate mrbeast s videos into multiple languages  but since your videos do not have this feature  your videos are not translated into more than one language  therefore  your videos mean nothing to them  but 208 countries do not watch and subscribe to your videos because they do not understand     abi bence senin mrbeast ten daha az abonen olmas n n nedeni onun videolar  birden fazla dil  eviriliyor   nk  youtube art k mrbeast in videolar n  otomatik olarak bir ok dile  eviriyor  ancak videolar n zda bu  zellik yoktur  bu nedenle  rne in youtube  mrbeast in videolar n  otomatik olarak birden  ok dile  evirecektir  ama videolar n zda bu  zellik olmad    i in videolar n z birden fazla dile  evrilmiyor  bu y zden videolar n z onlar i in hi bir  ey ifade etmiyor  ama 208  lke anlamad klar  i in videolar n z  izlemiyor ve abone olmuyor 
its just drive vs a guy who is over it cos he is content   both win <3
muhahhaahhahah
he is out here spitting facts
wow pewd s evolved into a good human
quran when 
mr beast has 123m subscribers now

you are the best always
i mean you are just 1 guy but mr beast rocks
i can t believe mr beast has surpassed pewdiepie   
hard work plays dude i have been following him since he 30m subscribe and he always support you am so happy for him for taking that stap

opera gx
have a look into islam and it is theology and it is teachings on life and afterlife and about the universe as well  hopefully would help you have a better understanding of life  insha allah  may allah guide you ameen 
pewds is just bad
everyone pass you   you are old news now    see where tseries is now   make a diss again   bot subs failed youtuber
everyone  bro you are at 9 subs
jealous ass right here
 mebatz47 bot army     i am saying tseries vs this fool who made diss but nothing changed   pewds on his downfall    
 coreintent no he is not hes just slowly quitting youtube because hes growing into more of an adult and having a family and an adult life
 mebatz47 that is what people say who fail   he wanted to diss tseries and indians   karma is a bad bitch bro
 coreintent he dissed tseries because its a company who does not do the right thing all the time they pirate some stuff too but he never said anything bad about the indians
mrbeast is better
i honestly would love to watch hear  pewdiepie talk about philosophy and dumb it down
content creation dead
i m just confused as to how a greenville nc native became such a popular youtuber lmao greenville nc sucks major ass and so do most of the people from there 
this is strange
pewdiepie best philosopher   do not sleep on epictetus 
 
please must read quran once in life
thank you felix i m two minutes in and some of the advice you ve given so far has taught me a lot i didn t even realise about myself
 almost every piece of literature regarding morality are mearly footnotes to the sermon on the mount  some dude i forgot his name
no way
pewdiepie  your the best best best best wow  the best ever  
      
            
bro look into religion like islam 
man i miss the old pewdiepie   barrel
try to read 1  holy quran english translation  2  1  muhammad  his life based on the earliest sources by the late dr  martin lings your life will change  thank me later
allez mr beast  
                                               
come to india 
merge with mrbeast
all good books  and all but one is sitting on my shelf right now  the book that is had the biggest impact on my life is ram dass   be here now  that book did not open my eyes so much as it ripped my eyelids off and forced me to look at shit differently   
i think you suppose to play games to get more subscribe  you are lucky because i still subscribe you
pewdiepie was definitely a phase for me   i followed him because of his horror content and then made video after video of boring content and then he decided to drop the n word multiple times and i dropped him   i don t support racists and i don t care if he apologized  if he was comfortable enough to say it on streams he s comfortable saying it in daily life   markiplier in my personal opinion deserves his spot on youtube   lol i don t know a single person that still actively watches felix 
122 million   you mean  
i d rather read the bible then budism
mrbeast gang    
bro s trying to get likes  
hasn t got one yet
 connorberry6377 he has now
 jokeman8467 just the one
imagine have more than 1000 likes on your comment lol 
you have gotten me excited to start reading and learning new things again   thank you  endlessly 
the best gamer  philosofer  gym bro and youtube idol man
    
4 10  attaining everything this world has to offer 
i do not think i have ever watched a whole mr beast video
 pewdiepie philly trenches really likes your content  i see you have a very high iq  keep up the amazing content
i remember when i got your book like 7 years ago  thank you for that
i am neutral  
the fact that you amassed over 100 million on your own and with your editor  sive  is absolutely amazing  to me and many others you are the number 1 youtuber  i m not dissing on mr beast i respect everything he did and the hard work  but it is impressive on how you built this huge following 
bro i d love you to do a talk with tfm he has his own philosophy book  you should read it it s called the way of the monkey
yes  
not being a closeted racist pays out  who would have thought 
if pewdiepie had translated your channel to more countries this would never have happened and worse seriously man you did not translate this video into portuguese brazil
mrbeast was a fan of you before his entire career  he was your biggest fan he said your name 100 000 times and donated you 1000 dollars 
you have always produced the most interesting  different and unique content  70  of youtubers have copied stealed your content for their content  you still produce and broadcast original content  but the other channel became famous for videos like  the difference between a  1 meal and a  1 000 meal  and is a favorite with kids between the ages of 5 and 14  i do not think a fool who treats people like his slaves with his money is a good moron  it is quality  not quantity  that matters  that is why you are the best  you are loved my friend 
1  explanation 99  swearing
mrbeast has 121m subscribes
yayyy  you suck and mrbeast rules  finallyyyyyyyy 
pewds  pls read some islamic book  it is good
at least you still have more overall video views if that makes you happy
wait 10 days later 10 more million subs waht about a year 365 million subs 
wow  i actually learned something 
i would pay to see pewdiepie read mein kampf
wowowowowoowowow pewdsssss damnnnnn this is big because i still no subscribe to mr beast hehe
hello pewdiepie  i am a new subscriber and i am from indonesia  i am glad to know your channel  i hope you are always healthy so you can create even better or crazier content
bruh shut mr brest is better  l

i  would like to thank american people for watching my very very simple videos   thanks a lot on you 
yes  mr beast channel is quickly increase of subscribers  but you have 111 million subscribers   it is enough you are both lagends and superstars 
the chosen one to beat t series
i can already see his brain enlarging by the minute
you are great legend i love science 
i been here since day 13376654 mr pubes
just started with gay science being my first philosophical book  its hard not going to lie  
do not worry but mr beast   is best for you   understand pewdiepie noob  
your the new you have no subs
pewdiepie highlights will pass him soon i am kind of suprised that pewdiepie highlights is growing 1000000 times the speed of pewdiepie
hahahahahaha you noob hahahahaha     
bot
it is been over 3 years since pewdiepie stepped down and entrusted mr beast to regain his lost throne  glad to see he is living up to pewdiepie s expectations  110 million to go  keep moving bro  for anyone who is not aware of what i mean  try watching pewdiepie s  congratulations  video for t series 
omg yes another book review merry christmas to me
i never thought this will never happen
for me this channel is just boring and random 
modded minecraft series when
like nastya is about to pass you too lol
mr beast appeared in fortnite  and i am guessing that ignited interest in his channel

yea because he cares about people and actually does things for people with the money he makes on here 
11 56 i was actually the one who photo shopped the mr beast tweet on the right
zamn
mr beast deserves this but somehow i cannot help but feel sad that there is some one with more subscribers than him 
love you felix
well i have never watched mr beast and honestly i have yet to recognize his face  anywhere  but i have got pews  he is wholesome 
bro mrbeast and literally the best youtube ever man
and another i never found your videos funny
 trolllgames6458 we do not care
man we always will miss the old dayes
mr beast became the thing he was trying to prevent   
i do not need to subscribe to anyone pewdiepie   unsubscribe  mrbeast   unsubscribe
i love this  the other videos are perfect  love the books
why you are  do not work with team like mr beast  your video is sooooo bad you need to change your camera and setup  who agree with me 
amazing video  this can really help a lot of people including myself thank you for voicing your knowledge
dead ass though  happy wheels made his channel blow up  if he did it again easy another mil subs
i knew this dayw was coming
mr beast videos are great but seem forced and well targeted  you get baited to watch them  and there is a good hook that keeps you going  and people like that  pewds vids feels reeler as if he is talking directly to us  as if we are in the same room  it is different and it is difficult to sustain the subscribers count 
delete your channel
i am so sorry to hear the news  legend has gone 
you should try islam bro  also you will always be known as a legend pewds
mrbeast destroyed him
we destroyed your mom   
 fathergascoigne2450 cringe
i got here to watch him talk about the passing of subs  i left here wiser than ever
id take happy wheels than this
today mrbeast have 122 million sub
check islam man 
it s funny how mrbeast first supported you to get 100m subs first before t series  and now here s mrbeast with over 100m subs
i recommend the holy bible  if you believe that jesus christ died for our sins  was buried  and raised to life on the third day  you will be saved  1 corinthians 15 3 4
pewdiepie should read the prince and a brave new world
pewds   whenever i drive to japan  sive   video edited by him shows korean instead of japanese 
mr beast 122m subscribe
he is giving away money though     also investing more on his channel and doing bigger things  so in a way  you are doing more with less  you got better roi  you win   p
does not matter if he is the newest top 1 youtuber i have believed you we are even the first youtuber of the 2010 2022 on youtube you did work harder to be the best guy of these year s have passed 
pewdiepie son finally got more subcriber
this man is amazingly genuine  be like him so the world would stop having booty outlooks on life  it is weird to me that people care about artificial accomplishments when one of the biggest creators is telling us that shit does not in the big skim on things 
mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track  mr beast diss track   it does not have to be a mean diss track  it could just be a fun one 
pewdiepie is better
no
i still want happy wheels part 200
i stay loyal to pewdiepie
bro needs to come back and play some horror games
so what at all do this man create   i m still wondering what his videos are about  
i happy that pewdiepie talked about buddha  s words 
llora pues
pewdiepie is slowly becoming my teacher 
i do not think he understands women s period and pregnancy cravings    
if you love god as your savior  
why are you still at the same amount though 
piew pie die es joto 
life is suffering  i do not subscribe to this  says the multibillionaire 
i like mr beast ok but i am still here listening to pewds dish about philosophy and self improvement  love to you and martzia 
well to be fair it costed mr beast a lot of money lols your videos are effortless and genuine  mr beast has to do a lot of bizzare things that involve money whether its giving money or spending money  not tryna hate on mr beast as hes a cool genuine dude too  but in my opinion he would be nowhere near your level if it was not for his money 
you still have more views if it helps sooth the copium withdrawl  
sabar
why if mrbeast beats you we all still remember you as a youtube legend
do not beat him dummy
tf 
can we get a happy wheels video lol
why is it titled mr beast passed me in s ubs 
nice    
xd
i love pewdiepie for being back minecraft 
0 32 in the buddha s words 3 23 the nicomathean ethics 5 39 epictetus enchiridion 8 03 the gay science 10 00 the mathematical universe
pewdiepie is still the legend     
he have now 122m  
your content is generally more better lol
you do not care about us wow
he never said that
god give me a heart attack so i do not have to watch pewdiepie give a damn book review
just don t watch the video g
i feel a great disturbance in the force  as if millions of subscribers suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced 
haha mrbeast rules just a joke pls no hate
and now you should collab
4 48 lol  you can use those social midias  just separate what it is correct and good from what is incorrect and evil  by the way  nice video  pewds 
we need more books
the person who climbed you passed you
he s been getting you subs respect him
stfu it s a joke
ok it was a joke bro but sorry 
6 01 sive that is a picture of korea
you should be proud of your son lord pewdz
bro what about  t series   
 we we dielive             pewds  captions
haha pewdiepie subs go brr
now read bible
now i want to see felix make a disstrack to mr beast 
but he would not
can we just notice that mrbeast grew 7m subs in 9 days
i think you can start painting
still the greatest youtube of all time
mr beast passend and 120 000 000
i feel like your career is over now
piyasaya  a lama
sorry pewds this is not the end
wow dude  this was a pretty helpful video  basically life boils down to   keep calm and vibe    lmao
mr beast s are obviously gotten because of him being rich which is not a true win doing casual things on youtube for years climbing subs like pewdiepie  its literally cheating but its good to sometimes let go and not sleep on it as the top 
finaly
7 26 holy shit  that is what i kept thinking of 
your book review of dune got me into reading more and challenging myself after finding out i was dyslexic in my 3rd year ba architecture at university of brighton  i have now got a collection of books since then that i have read so cannot thank you enough pewds 
can i have a shoutout
bro one of the best videos  more v deos like this 
epictitus lol
bro just play minecraft again lots of people still want you to play   edit  a bot replied to me  
mrbeast clapping after congratulations was forshadowing 
6 51 one word   kanye 
strange 
i am mr beast s subscriber but today i subscribed you too 
he bought it though
fu
fu wu too
mr beast    
please more
king pewdie pie mr beast shield
it is ok your alone making your video and mr beast is not lonely to make videos
still number one as a single individual with subs on youtube 
it s alright bro  you ll always be number one to us   
no
 ingl s con leandro everyone has different opnions
no he is not lol
how does the book love me
sum thought about kllyh clarkson
noo pudidi  
8days later he got 7million subs more wow
also mr told me he would for me
you coulda wore sweet leather jacket   rep
pewdiepie is the king of all times  mrbeast is the brave knight that help the world
who cares about about number of followers  when all of them are in love with you 
it is been months now since your in 111m subs
what about t series   
wtf  he is changed  wtf happened to amnesia niiggaa 
looks like mrbeast is going to avenge for pewds after losing to t series
i mma need some book review alert squad notices  love me some book club 
mr beast helping pewdiepie to beat t series 3 years ago was like a trampoline to mr beast in popularity      
the thing about being happy regardless of material or outside things is just bullshit  going for work and wasting 8h a day  1h for ride home back an forth every day to the day i die and lose all my dreams or be a milionare and do what i want everyday  which option would make most people happy you think  stupid concept overall  its like coping for majority  just smile when life fucks you in the asshole 
collaboration with mr beast
1 t series 2 cocomelon 3 mr beast 4 pewdiepie
you fake
6 50 do not be elon musk  got it
to be fair  he is a lot more interesting than you
any day it had to happen  and it happened  v
mrbeast has 122 1 millon subs now
you mean 122 million subbs
we need a red rising book review please god
not me just learning that the enchiridion did not originate from adventure time
me beast broke a promise that he made over 4 yea rd ago  that he would not pass predispose in subs  but that fateful day as today 
pewds is a legend man  you cannot beat that  hell i do not even know what is mrbeast until he did that sub to pewds during the pewds vs t series 
read  the bitcoin standard
waiting for the day pewds returns to minecraft
funny thing is that  on average  women do have fewer teeth than men  despite periodontal disease being more common in men  women tend to lose more teeth 
that s why mr beast is the best guy
guys  its now  mrbeast versus t seris 
kein problem  the 111 millions of red buttons is always a amazing number of galaxy   
dok adnie
ok let us be honest mr beast help you out so much and shouted you out so much and i am glad he got what he deserved although i am sorry bro 
yes   finally  a book review  keep going pewdiepie    we love your reviews 
mr beast pased his idol
you are still the king to me  even if you do not have the most subscribers 
i laughed way too hard at the social media joke  
if you look at the cocomelon youtube channel they have 150 million subscribers more than both of you guys
and t series he has 256m subs 
mrbeast straight up came out of nowhere and absolutely knocked pewdiepie out of the water
to be honest  this was expected for me   mr beast creates crazy content and his efforts should have been rewarded sooner or later   more importantly  mr beast has separate teams from different countries preparing professional voiceovers for videos in other languages  and this further expands the circle of people who will want to subscribe   just imagine 11 foreign tracks in each of his videos  not counting english 
i am about to asian and this book r normal 
real question here  is not trying to continually be a good person a craving and therefore suffering  how about instead of always trying to better  do not be so hard on yourself and just live life in the moment  i really love this topic though and pewds made me laugh countless times haha 
a guy laughing at his own jokes  it was time someone really qualified did better  lol
cuz mr beast is better
 out of context but pewdiepie  poor harley dilly was subbed to you that poor 14 yr old that tried getting into an vacant house poor kid suffocated slowly  poor kid died a slow death rip
f
tf you saying f for
bro have not goten 1m subs in months
i was here
noooooo
i was hoping for a diss track but ended up educated 
i ignore both of you guys but here i am because this just had to cross my feed and force upon me a reason to leave a comment and still not watch  you are welcome 
you sold your soul  you deserve it
source 
seriously i say happy wheels
why does this guy have 111 million subscribers 
because he doing good video s 
t series is beating you both in subscribers
i do not know about all of what you are saying we can clearly see in peoples actions evil and good do exist
hey felix  been watching you since happy wheels days   had a question for ya      clearly you ve  conquered  youtube  your currently focusing on your physical health  but are you working on any other projects other than that  i know myself would get board really quick without another goal to reach or surpass  so are you going to try to  conquer  something else 
disstrack for mr beast on its way
mr beast now 121m subs
why god p
tools to see your videos in several languages   please
it does not matter if mrbeast passed you on subscriber just keep making nice contains 
you mean content
good afternoon mohammad hassan 
 
you do not care about arabs like mr  best
well mr  beast will probably beat set india next
no 
what is this man talking about   
lol  pewdiepie finally beat up
make indonesia audio bro 
shtafakap
guys soobskribeded to pewdiepie
mr beast>>
crazy to think mr beast was the main guy trying to get pewdiepie to 100 mil subs in the first place
maybe aristotle did check and wife did not get her wisdom teeth in so she did have less teeth  he should have checked other mouths 
2016 pewdiepie   2022   
no offense and i am being real mr  beast is a wholesome caring and fun person  your opposite lol plus he did help you get subs for a long time to try and beat stupid melon garbage  i subscribe to you both  but mr  beast do not hate all people and mean
do more fridays with pewdiepie 
respect pewdiepie because he said in his videos he doesn t care if  mr beast passed him  
don t give up pewdiepie
tenang pudidi aku subs kamu
bro he just explained the whole world including each and every government in one line   if you have the fear of losing what you have  you are ultimately being controled by it  timestamp  around 7 00
see  although mrbeast has passed in subscribers  i still count you as the most subscribed youtuber  mrbeast would not be as popular as he is if he did not give away as much stuff as he does  based on simple content itself  you still are on top  take away mrbeasts money and he would not be as popular  take away your money  and you would still have 111 000 000  subscribers  like you said ages ago  context matters
6 00 editor does not know different between japanese and korean
maybe you can pass mr beast again in the future  
i missed the point where  felix opened a book club
if we are being real  i would rather have mrbeast be the most subscribed channel instead of t series
another surpass in subs  ppft  is not it too late to try being king of you tube 
mbeast 
aonak kharap lagtasa bro
love this content
hope you will read the quran soon  
your vids always put me in a good mood  man  cheers 
pewdiedie this channel  i still cannot understand what the hell is being said  can someone please explain
nah you re fuming   
hello  love to all
pewdiepie really does not care about mrbeast passing him in subs but is so passionate of talking about philosophy 
man  i have not seen this mofo since 2020 good to see you still alive but your age of glory is over  yet you have cemented your name in the internet history books
mr beast lost 8mil subs
if i didn t need to eat or have a house definitely watching pewdiepie all day
you do not learn  do you  people change over time  and that includes hobbies  enthusiasms etc  you will not be the same as before unfortunately 
honestly  this is what i m here for  but i love everything else you do  but this is my favorite 
  i see  we need to bring you up to speed with what is going on   and as for mr beast  let us just say eyes have been on him for some time now     
pewdiepie l like  all your video 
mr beast is a con artist
i like it when pewdiepie talks about the stoics and stoicism  the wisdom on this man   
pewd help me get 2k subs plzzz merry christmas    
you are always my number 1 pewds
pewdiepie isn  t justo a phase  it is a lifestyle

i feel that your going to retire you will always be a king let us gooo felix 
he already retired
i know the odds of this being seen are very low  but i recommend the  book of job  from the bible  it is full of incredible lessons  space science  the water cycle  and references the extinction of the dinosaurs which is heavily over looked when the time of writing this book had no possible way to know the things talked about 
you will always be  1 in everybody s mind
lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize

congratulations you have been selected among my three lucky winners hit me up on     
people spend so much effort trying to suppress natural human instincts  desires for ultimate happiness  ultimate justice  immortality  and freedom from suffering  there are two possibilities  believe that those desires are unobtainable  and try to suppress them unnaturally  or believe that those desires are actually there for a purpose  to drive us to search for true meaning  personally  i strive for the latter 
let us go cena i mean pewdiepie
i read your book  it made me feel stupid and loved at the same time  don t know how i feel about it bro

i love the whole timeline of pewdiepie s legacy  it really shows off how much he has developed as a person and for me he is really a guy to look up to 
did you like his pubg timeline 
 stonecoldmike yes
 stonecoldmike that was like 100 years ago  let it go  mike  let it go 
beluga
he said the n word
 pessithefraud who cares nigga

imagine being admired by a fan and now surpassing you  
imagine a collab with mr beast and pewdiepie o
pewds will always be king of youtube
you should definitely read the quran
man getting old
this is irobotic is 642 years old one subscribe one year old
aristotles wife just had super poor dental health and told her husband  no i didn t lose my teeth uhh   all of us are like that  and he just didn t question it 
mr beast much better bro
e
your still the king
the era of pewdiepie is now over  
i would love to see a video from felix on his view of death  what gives me the most anxiety when i think about it is what happens after we die  not what happens with our bodies but our soul  and not from a religious point of view 
caused mr beast love to give people everythings and god has no doubt to give him more 
tell t series that his reign is about to be over
i have nothing to do today  so i am just going to write stupid shit on your video 
pewdiepie i know that your retired now but plsss do a diss track for mr beast just tradition pllslsss
because your noob
does not even know what noob means
mrbeast has 121m subs now
is that really you 0
god damn you are almost a sage  ill teach you more if you want to knw  find me in the mountains  the rainstorm and the river are my brothers the heron and the otter are my friends and we are all connected to each other in a circle  in a hoop that never ends you can own the earth and still all you will own is earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind
pewdiepie  while you are trying to be all time space influential and what not  i have already emblazoned the trail to backwards in time travel by communicating with the future to figure out how they did it mf  you think i am joking ok here is the bet  you do it first then and whoever loses dies  i am just kidding of course but haha fooled ya  i bet you would like to know how i know all of these secrets because i am god whaaaaaaa  are you still reading this anyway why am i detracting from the good material am i just adding in filler to waste time absolutely  i wonder how guga cooks those steaks so perfectly  i wonder why ocean water tastes like my girlfriend  do mermaids even know how to swim or do they just sing  why does my phone even ring  i bet you thought i was done 
could somebody play my roblox game  neon obby  speedrun  pls
i wonder who who hooked this mf on knowledge like crack cocaine  hello 
i think mr beast deserves it  they have a ton of production value  but man you dominated youtube for a decade so that is something and you are still up there 
dude you used to be like 15  are you like 50 
shoot it should have been happy wheels
someone inside youtube has boosted mrbeast channel  i have never in my career ever seen anyone get 50 to 100 million videos per video  this is someone is boosting this guys channel to the moon  that is in the wake of logan paul s scandal with where the money went  the same thing actually applies to mr beast  back in the early days he was throwing away money like candy  and at the same time  he can somehow grow channel  anyone with accounting degree would see that he is spending more money than he gets from youtube back in the early days  which leads me to believe he was doing a similar fraud scheme  someone needs to investigate mr beast 
yea i agree on someone boosting him but i highly doubt that he is a fraud business wise  but most likely youtube is boosting mrbeast 
lol mrbeast now has 121m subs vs you who has 111m subs but you are still pretty good keep it up
bro if you want upgrade you sub make a short vidio of you vidio
this guy is so trash in compared to mrbeast
the buddha said  life is suffering  in the sense that you will always suffer in life no matter who or what you are  you are always desiring and attaching to things  therefore suffering in life is inevitable  and the escape is enlightenment or in abrahamic religions it is called salvation or heaven 
hello

para mim seu coment rio sobro o twitter   ruim  o twitter   melhor que o facebook 
 
do chairs exist  
who tf is mr beast
a youtuber there make chennalges and giving mony on hies followers
all this books  just read one book  the bhagavad gita  all in one book  you can find your life goal  happiness  etc
         
thank you
 
honestly good advice
pewds   please do not take my legs also pewds   does not have legs
bro six days later he is now at 121m
calm down bruh  mr beast is a team  and you are a solo 
why use a broke be ass gps machine when there is google maps 
   
great video  very educational  keep it up 
do not worry pewdie you r the first one to hit  real 100m subs without using bot subs  like t series did 
its funny that he started out fighting for pewds spot at the top
the songbook you created before is very good  you can find a team to create and sing  you sing very well  even mr  beast can t surpass it
pewdiepie s era is over   
wow amazing
the padawan became the jedi
how he s talking
1 55 charlie 
to be honest this content is mid   this is overrated
ik vond dit erg inspirerend   
do not know man  his team probably does 80  of that effort with how much crap his name is on now for marketing  and they are not thinking of people or the earth  just cash  mr beast should fire them and control his own branding  trust me pewds  mr beast is the phase  you are a way of life bro  
i really hope you are beliefs are keeping you strong during these days 
lol the fan over takes the youtuber
imagine having someone who supported you in your sub count surpass you
if you want to read some more modern philosophy  i recommend alan watts   the wisdom of insecurity 
xddd
youtube movies has more then mrbeast
mr beast is just money but you not   but your a good gamer
are not no way you were this dumb mr beast worked so hard and his team to surpass pewdiepie why cannot you just accept the fact that mr beast passed pewdiepie for being a hard worker  
i discovered max tegmark a year ago through his talks about symbolic regression  ai feynman  honestly one of the greats currently 
most peoples loves mr beast s impossible challenge contents pewdie  he is challenge contents quality is higher than you i say to be honestly but a little bit of mr beast subscribers love you are contents if they love read a book
bring back fan mail  
mrbeast 
it is curious to see pewds interested in stuff that he did not learn in school and that sounds very complicated  like the mathematics book  my instant reaction was  ew  math  no   but then i remembered how sometimes i find it super interesting when my dad explains me this super complex math stuff  my dad is a university math teacher so he deals with stuff that it is too complicated for me to understand  and i never liked math  but sometimes it is fun to just think about it when he talks about it and i can just freely think and slowly comprehend it without having to really memorize it for school  it hits differently  
everyone unsubscribe from mr beast     no don t do it 
mr beast comment plsss
mr beast thumbnail         
mr beast is beter by the way
you re  1 and always will be  well k ll mr beast  in fortnight   i ll always be back to watch your videos  ily pewds   also  rip maya and i m sorry for your loss

when the student surpasses the teacher

happy wheels pt2 would be amaziiinggggggg
technically mr  beast has 200 mil combined with his other channels
technically pewdiepie has 111 mil 770 thousand combined with his other channel
 engtilde bruh mrbeast has 3 other channels with 20 million subs  plus a 200 mill sub channel 
 mr fullplays13 i know
you lost
you need to create more bots then  3
mr beast  money 
still the first youtuber to pass 100 million subs  that s a huge accomplishment
pewdiepie you should read  confessions  by saint augustine 
quran when 
clickbaits mr  beast passing him in subscribers  immediatly starts reviewing books he read for 12 minutes  does not elaborate 
it s not clickbait
love that you are promoting philosophy 
i am kind of happy mrbeast beat you
this man nvr ages 
this channel is the best ride on yt   anyone remember beastmaster64 phase  
                          
money always win
mr beasr is 100  better than you 
not true
 samuraj7209  that is true
 musicswithai nah
 samuraj7209  mrbeast is better
 musicswithai but for me is pewdiepie better
 samuraj7209 but for me is mrbeast better
philosophy felix is 50 50 sometimes he is pompous but a lot of others times he is right and has a point
let us make fake accounts  
in five days  mrbeast made 6 million estimates
mr beast is a beast  i do not like your content  i like hardworking content 
felix you know that you do not need a such subs to be that famous the real thing you need is your family and atlest you have a subscribers
pewds  nietzsche is end game philosophy  it is recommended to be max level before grappling with his work  i recommend reading some anselm 
the second book names is aristotle s nicomachean ethics if anyone  did not get what felix said it
never thought book reviews were going to be so interesting
its okay
mr beast no idea who that is 
                                                                                                                                        
i hate reading it s boring and i can t focus that long bye
you do not respect mr beast  
pewdisism haha   i hope you slowly understand reason of our existence   what is our mission as human before we die and go to the next mode   try read quran
princess bubblegum  the enchiridionnnn
cool
mrbeast is still a company  pewds will forever remain the crowned king of youtube
you are a legend you will always be the best youtube king
lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize  
i love your content
i would actually be mad at you if mrbeast deletes his channel nice video though
time will never be the same
haha mr beast is better
you pewdiepie you lose  mr beast is best youtuber
i d like recommend my favorite book that changed my perspective on a bunch things and really struck my heart   the irresistible revolution  living as ordinary radical  by shane claiborne  shanes journey is so incredible 
would have really enjoyed happy wheels
1 minute in and this guy trying to get me into buddhism  imagine if he picked up a quran instead  his experience would be a lot better ngl 
i like mrbeast
mr beast 120m pewpiedie 111m
would be interesting to compare how much you have donated youtube money n how much he did  it is incomparable dude 
even if mr beast has more subs than you  you still more popular than him  i do not know how to explain it you are a very important person in the youtube universe and i just learned about a sad new rest in peace maya     
life reminder from the master haha
you have our support on the flow of the channel    the core ideas of buddhism are pretty practical too  you should try meditation  if you find time 
his subs just don t grow thaaatttt much anymore
mrbeast better
it is kids content
 vergelfamisaran7060 you are wrong
kid you are too young to be here
you
mans become an old lady 
mrbeast is like getting a million subs after a week or so 
according to the statistics from social blade  he is getting a million subs in every 2 5 days 
in all honesty  i m glad pewds is able to give up his mantle to the new guy  i think he s a lot happier without all the pressure of being on top 
a subtle art of not giving a fck  i recommend that book 
thank you big bro pewds
do a bible book review
to be honest  i don t actually like mrbeast 
bozo
you know how it works  just give me 1 million and shoot my reaction  your welcome
i like pewd for his edgy humors  i have never like mr beast s content because his content feels more aim toward fortnite tiktok kids  stamp big money to it  and put overly excited soyjak face  mr beast s content always feels like all about big money  to me  he is like spongebob fancy pants  i will always be one of the pewd bros   
pewds does nothing to his fans though  literally known for screaming and stealing content from others 
deny yourself what you want  until you want something better 
he is beast lasagne   delicious  but would not want him every day  you are more like  pizza   
w
3 43 the most hilarious moment  
i smell another diss track
pewds will always be my go to youtuber
 hiviosguanchas like comment and sub and do not forget to share
mr beast   my favorite for crazy   cool stuffs  mr pewds   my favorite gamer  reviewer   entertainer  i missed him playing scary games  these two are both legends     
love mrbeast vs pewdiepie    
agreed i love both of them
t series are not nothing but
charity porn sucks
pewdiepie is racist he deserved to have no subs ngl
 realsekirogamerz itch
f you t series coco melon and sony set  all 3 are just companies  mr beast and pewdiepie r the legit yt leaders
 gamersrule7502 indeed
missed happy wheels series too to be honest
 realsekirogamerz still not defamation
how about series
i always support you pewdiepie  keep up the good work
its not your era again
i think mrbeast s content is more qualified  but i like you too
the name pewdiepie already marked in our hearts forever 
you should read the best book of all time  al quran 
it is ok pewdiepie mr beast fans are ipad kids trust 
you remember mr beast 4 years ago said   were going to make this video the 2nd most viewed youtube video because we woukld never beat pewdiepie and we do not want to  that did not age well 
1 15 to 1 26 deal        
your cont is not so intreresting  anymore bro
whoa that intro track is wild
dis him do it
well i guess a new war
are you real
everyone is passing pewdiepie he should just give up
pewdiepie is our priest  
you should read a shorter version of the bible  i want to know your thoughts on it 
  ill see you in a couple years      
thank you pewdiepie for the book reccs  needed to read something and i could not find anything interesting 
yo pewds you ve grown so much  much love   thanks for the awesome moments you ve given us
still  felix is a legend 
bruh beast is on 120m right now ha
dose this also relate to your japan experience
good and bad is real just as  positive  and  negative  7 24
thanks i m going to give these a read   always looking for more understanding and acceptance with what it  thanks pewds   
you are not interested in watching you speak english  a russian person does not understand you  make a translator on your channel and you will have even more subscribers at your dacha

try doing interesting or survival challenges instead of talking to the machine  it will help increase interaction and the audience will love it more  remember to add vietnamese subtitles  your vietnamese audience is quite large 
and french

pewds has good taste in philosophers 
adam n 111 milyon takip isi var ama sadece 3 milyon izleniyor abi adam  unuttular art k ya land  dediler amk
i am so proud to have followed your growth over the years
stoicism   rich kid problems 
you should read ikigai  the japanese secret to a long and happy life by hector garcia and francesc miralles  to very briefly summarize  it is about the japanese meaning of life and purpose  and how it should be lived  pursued and viewed based on our talents and skills as well as our views and ideologies of life 
buddhism is derived from hinduism so might as well read the upanishads 
how did he fu king read that many book s 
mr beast technically ratioed you
yo bro review the way of the superior man
mrbeast does not deserve it

lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize  
well pewds era already past their prime time and he desevred to rest retired as youtubers  mr beast or other surpassing him is not surprising even though its amazing  but the most amazing is pewds still at 111m after 2 years slower uploading contents and change of contents landscapes did not faze him at all  i just hoped mr beast as the face of youtube nowadays did not disappoint in the end  i never clicked with the content or su s to him but so far i see hes not a bad guys or drama hungry  so i hoped his reign or whoever will took the reign years later is better  pewds era  the 2nd generations  is over 
loh
you can read all the books in the world but if you don t apply the teachings that you read then it will always be in vain  i feel like stoicism in modern society gives people an excuse to not overcome obstacles in your life and instead be complacent with life without trying 
noob mistr bist pro
mrbeast has 120m sub now
 pewdiepie03  pewdiepie pls dance like wednesday on youtube for you are subscribers
 pewdiepie03  please i will tell my whole fam to sub to you
please subscribe to pewdiepie to stop mrbeast 
unsubscribe pewdiepie now
never 
i remember not wanting to watch the popular youtubers because i thought they would be stupid and foolish  but i have been pleasantly surprised by pewdiepie in the years that i have been watching him  he is smart  wise  funny  and surprisingly humble  it was then that i realized why he was so loved  he deserves it  great guy 
i have been late to his channel and looking at his recent  philosophy  videos and  no  there is nothing here  literally the most unfunny and unintelligent channel you can find on youtube  it is baffling 
 raimundomuthemba766 true
 raimundomuthemba766 haters going to hate  i actually enjoyed what he had to say in this video  it opens up my mind and to other possibilities  also if you have nothing good to say  then do not say it  because truth is  very few will ever care about your opinion  because i think his subscriber count would definitely disagree
 raimundomuthemba766he s literally admitted that he s just desperate for more money because he wants to buy a house in japan
 krismiw9198  of pewdiepies sub count do not watch his vids anymore
 validt same goes with other big youtubers like jacksepticeye  markiplier  they have 30 million subscribers but their views are like 0 1  of their subscribers  what is your point 
the bests ones are also the most humbles
 ima fadzil i like jacksepticeye  but pewdiepie is definitely my favorite of the popular youtubers 
really enjoy pewds philosophy
you could have 300 milllion if you gave out money   d
did not aristotle also taught it is pupils including alexander the great something like   everyone except the greeks are inferior and shall be treated as such   he later on dropped those beliefs but teeths seriously  
a really good book that changed my view of life was collative learning systems  but that is just me 
why you do not hit 112m subs
mr beast diss track 
the retired grandpa of youtube
as a buddist i glad he reviewed it 
why was the gps in that car korean  lmao i thought you drove in japan
ffs cannot you name your videos properly  i skipped this video based on title and thumbnail but it is a fucking book review which i love  thank god i decided to watch  i removed subreddit  where you said this crap is book review  
you try watching the cocomelon youtube channel
try reading al quran bro
we love you felix 
lol at this rate make a video on how to get youtube video views
you doo well but
dropped like for thumbnail lmaooo
no se merece superarte
religion sucks 
please do a happy wheels  please
buddhism is also about causality  how things end up the way it ended up  why you are suffering or why you are happy  all that comes down to your actions in your current  past  and future lives  it is all up to you   pretty neat
i am just here to say that i love your philosophy content  i have been exploring philosophy myself  and it is so cool that you  my favorite youtuber  are doing the same  and i get to hear some of your thoughts on the subject 
mr beast is the best
does beast have a chance to surpass t series 
pew die
lol
 tejasbhatt5779 deez
bro it took over 12 years for someone to finally pass this man lol let s just put that out there
love you  pewds   
you both doing extraordinary  
pewdiepie big brain 
i do not know which year i started watching you  it is probably in my junior high school year but i am a college graduating student now and i still prefer your video more than mr  beast  not hating though  i like him as a person  he has a good heart  i find his video repetitive giving and showing money whatsoever  again  i am not hating just my preference  but damn  i never thought mr  beast would surpass you  that is an achievement and happy for him   just here to say how much your video contribute to my mental health when school and home were not kind to me  i will never be tired of watching your video over and over again   all your walkthrough playthrough videos in my all time favorite  but can you do another kitchen nightmare video  hehe  thank you  
very insightful  i will be reading a few of these at least  thank you philosopher felix
the fact that this is the same guy who tried to help him on beating t series was surprising 
the best book is  this book loves you  by pewdiepie
bro pewdiepie fell off so hard
t series has more subs that if you combine pewdiepie and mrbeast than also more
we love you poods   does not matter if he passed you in subs you will always be our fav   brofist  
mr  beast is too busy making clickbait content and spend insane amounts of money on it  i do not understand how someone can watch him  the videos are so loud and annoying   
came here to laugh  stayed for happiness  been following pewds since 2014  it is been amazing how much he has grown  it is wholesome 
you are not on fortnite
how does all this match up with owning two expensive cars  drinking gfuel every day  owning the newest phone and buying a bag full of useless japanese toys  i do not get it
still waiting for part 200
alan watts videos are pretty good too 
as a buddhist i have no words
mr beast could never be this guy  never
remember kids that  good and bad  is something we made up  but it is still pretty relevant for our lives and we cannot ignore it   saying to each other that  good or bad  do not exist and pretending you are above it  is like a rooster saying to another rooster that the  pecking order  does not exist  if you chose to go against the law your own species made up  you will pay very existent consequences 
read fr  seraphim rose  you are welcome 
it s great to see how much you ve grown  to me you ll always have a special place in my heart  <3
bro mrbeast gained 5 mil subs in 4 days
why guy do not him down let him get up subscriber
proud of being a buddhist    
                      
no books you talked about will help people spiritually  i recommend reading all religion s books and try finding the true path i life
noooooooo your losing to him
i like the break down of each book   i like the examples you use  clear and concise  
it is so nice to see that even extremely popular people can stay completely out of any toxicity and encourage   influence other people positively  i wish you all the best in everything what you are doing  keep it up and regards from tokyo to tokyo  
  hehskekskseoskeksyepyepbabyyy do people not change and stay the way they are forever 
12 min on the dot
8 01 best part xd
go mr beats                                
already 120mil  
 
pew and beast is different genre
pewdiepie why not a 30 days   30 eggs challenge 
i learned that a few  years ago with buddhism  while i am not religious i did read that you can suffer if you have any wants or desires  since then i completely removed all wants or desires  now i could careless  i never cared about wanting things before because my parents taught me to be content with what i have  this probably might be crazy since you do not have the same wants as others  but i find that i do not care what others have 
let us go pews vs jimmy
long live the king
s ubs
unsubscribed  because you said bad things about my country  malaysia  tq for everything for past 11 years
your a lo er 0 51
yyyyeeeeeessssssss
thank you
rich as can be and smart  you look to what can maximize happiness in life  virtue gets you most of the way there  jesus christ saves  amen  hallelujah 
plato over aristotle any day  fight me 
read the book of mormon
if you liked the first book  read the bible  with an open minded perspective 
and read the book of mormon with an open minded perspective
hey pewds  i think it is great that you are still loving ancient greek literature and philosophy  there is still a lot more wonderful dialogues of plato  as well as the satirist lucian  whose dialogues of the dead are a personal favorite  also worth reading are the great tragedians and comedians  who also have a strong philosophical undercurrent
thank you pewds
i forgot pewdiepie existed
felix will always be number one in our heart
you are still  1 to millions  i may not watch your content much these days  but you were a positive force in my teen years  thank you for doing what you love for the sake of entertaining  brofist   
69 likes  nice 
cap
i come back every once and a while to watch him  and his videos are still entertaining to me  even when it started to take a different direction since 2014
 quadratic formula your mother
actuallt fr3d was the first youtuber to reach a million subscribers
  ekn8907 pewds is the first person to get to 100milion
 notmeggii actually that was t series pewdiepie was at 96m when t series hit 100m
 ekn8907 see  i said person not corporation
hell yea
 notmeggii still wrong
 magolor32 no it is not
nope
 ekn8907 and when was the last time you watched a t series video 
 mjt1517 never
no  he is not n1 anymore  there is plenty that have more subs than felix  its life  he does not put the same a mount of work  he is not as passionate anymore 
 ekn8907 i do not think you understand common english   ngl
 franciscopereira5760 that is your opinion keep it for yourself lol 
 somdudrmania it is true  pdp lost his relevancy all due to lack of passion  he doenst have it anymore
 ekn8907 he said person
 quadratic formula wtf
 donaldducksaverussia8923 you are cap
so pewdiepie is  1 even though mr beast spends millions for entertainment  makes  no  sense
 jamesepikman it is his opinion though
i do not know why but reading this replies make me want to puke
beast the best
i will never pick mr  beast of revelations over the pewdiepie
 franciscopereira5760 4 is plenty now i guess
 franciscopereira5760 by  plenty  you mean 4 right 
just yes  nothing to add bro
 sheepiihd n not any more
 butermaslo no
no se meta con mrbeastttttt 
he s still technically the most subscribed solo youtuber  as mrbeast is more of a company now and all the other big channels are media companies  yes including cocomelon
whatever anyone is saying  he literally said he doesn t care  
  notmeggii its t series not pewdiepie
  franciscopereira5760i agree
  jamesepikmanfr
  gtm692fr
 rose blue1 again  tseries is a corporation  pewdiepie a single guy  so he is the first person to get to 100kk
i did not know this was a book review until the subredditt video
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ   0 01
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ 
i knew mr beast will overtake you in subs
who else here feels like popping the pimple on his lip 
lol  jimmy tried to get you lots of subscribers in the old days  and now he is passed his own admirer  lol

please make more of these videos  love me some philosophy
thank you for the book review 
i did not know mr  beast was even close to 100mill subs  lol
11 58 what you all came to see like to thank me and help others
funny how he mentioned twitter and instagram but not youtube
a
pewdiepie is the greatest philosopher of our generation
1 man and 1 editor vs a production studio  
the problem is that she is making videos for other people from other countries as well  while you are limited to the audience that understands english 
i see you have decided to read the greeks
don t worry  you are still the first one haveing 100 milion subs
he will still be the face of the golden years of youtube forever
good video  i really like this book reviews  they are refreshing  lots of love
where  are  the  vlogs 
love from       
help meeee
sir
this man could seriously pull some g k chesterton sh t if all this philosophy study ends up making him a catholic 
most mr beast subscribers be like llllllllllllll        
wewe dielive
no joke  this is his best kind of videos
this is not important  i love you  
you got big l
pewds out here posting some real wisdom         i genuinely wish i was this wealthy to explore life  create good habits  and reflect on life itself

hey everyone help me to promote this gofundme campaign  i want to raise money for this child    need of large intestine surgery as soon a possible  i uploaded details on go fund me
suffering drives happiness  progress of man is what keeps him happy  as a fan of nitzche yourself  you should know this  if you take away desires from your life  sure you will not suffer  but you will not be happy either  i recommend you follow the buddhist way if you want to be an apathetic being that reaches nirvana if you believe it  otherwise  suffer  for progress 
it is impossible to compete with someone who dubs their videos into different languages   and makes the most insane videos that everyone would like to see but always thought it was not possible
ok
i still remember that in 2018  mrbeast with 16m subs uploaded a video about paying 1m dollars for people to subscribe to pewdiepie  now in 2022 mrbeast surpassed him  damn  
g ller att hoppas att pewdiepie fortfarande kan svenska  d
felix  really grew up w us
read the book of five rings plz
there s a reason pewdiepie became the face of chad
i am sad because today i did not have any subscribers
he was nervous that is why he separated the first s in  subs  in the title
love this episode so much

the best way to beat mrbeast again in subscribers is to start giving away money  people love to see charity 
missed you gang  
just need to make a song for mrbeast the same as he made for the t series
     
mrbeast is a brand you re an individual and small team
indonesia       
hi old pal  i am in my 20s now and started watching you when i was 12  when you made your facade videos  i have not watched much the past couple years  but i will never forget all of the great times i had watching you growing up  how many rough times you got me through  you were a good male role model for a kid with few of them  thank you  wishing you luck 
racist ah mf
loving your contents
y all remember when book review was like the atom bomb during the pewdiepie vs t series race
good content  hopefully i get 1k subscribers  thank you for inspiring me pewds i will make you proud 1 day 
mrbeast is clickbait i do not know what funny about his videos unless he bought fake viewers and subs
you are legend  
i just watched the live subs count pewdiepie did not got a single new subscriber in the time mr beast got 400
i guess pewdiepie is a bit hard to understand for non english speakers like me while mr beast is very easy to understand
is he saying the philosopher epic tittis  
happiness < joy
sorry pewdiepie now the video is not boring like before  i have to admit it
          
you are just like a lone wolf  singlehandedly accompanying many people through  perhaps  their childhood or even hard times 
that minecraft era was revolutionary
i recommend you read the holy bible  felix  what is stopping you  you read all about other religions and philosophy but avert the bible   sheesh 
 mr beast
put book review in the title  that way i would click  
if youtubers are pokemons pewdiepie is arceus   
            
stoicism is just an escape from the consequences of one s uselessness  it is an escape  stop it  take back control  escape the matrix 
he has 119m right now but i like pewdiepie if you want me to be honest
                            
6 books tha tchanged the way i think   number 1  mein kampf 
                 
i was wondering pewds will you ever read the quran  outside of reading it to become muslim i believe the quran gives alot of life lessons and helps you to start to think about life  in a different way 
i miss insomnia
is pewdiepie officially buddhist omg i am proud

in terms of stoicism  how do you actually go about not caring when something goes wrong or you re going through a hard time  did philosophers mention how to implement it into your daily life  wondering because i have anxiety and as much as i can try to let go and not let things bother me when they are out of control i can t seem to help it  i have done therapy many many times and am on medication  advice appreciated
it is more about accepting the things you cannot control than not caring  i try to assess hard times without overthinking  if i cannot think logically or i have spent too much time i will do things that keep me entertained or happy and try again later or the next day  also iin my opinion procrastination or too much time on my hands is my worst enemy when it comes to anxiety

happiness comes from being virtuous  well done 
rare moment of pewdiepie where he talks about books and philosophy and it is amazing to see that this guy has that kind of mind after watching him do weird videos in the past   
we all know pewds is the king  he has an actual interesting perspective and unique thoughts  not the personality of a cardboard box

mr  beast diss track 
before i opened the video i was wondering what happended to the book review  i am glad you are still doing them  i recently discovered gregory of nyssa   on the soul and resurrection   maybe you would be interested too  its a dialogue between st  gregory and his sister macrina  in the style of plato  written in the 4th century  a combination of greek philosophy and early christian theology  beautifully written 
pewds the monk
pewds radiating retired energy  which is chill
hey  maybe you can still do happy wheels part 200 if you really want to do it  it s all up to you
he hit  4m subscribers 3 days later  is he botting

how are you this heavily shadow banned  i ve been subbed for over a decade  yet your videos never appear in my feed 
this is literally one of the best videos i have ever seen  thank you felix  seriously 
this is good stuff 
mannn i thought you died or sum
goddamn
team pewdiepie
but felix  i get all my memes from instagram 
pewds just invest your money and fuck youtube  just do want to do  
i am very sorry

pewds tearing apart aristotle s theory that women had fewer teeth with  you could have just checked bro  you had a wife  i googled it  sent me
cool haircut
this is not a world i want to live in anymore  
o
got click baited but watched the entire video on buddhism  stoicism and philosophy
book review letsgoooo
even if jimmy passed felix  felix will always be remembered and never forgotten  he will be remembered as a brother  as a friend  as a man who made history              i just clicked on a notification and found out i got so many likes  
he was like a father to me
jimmy on the other side is just a philosophers bad dream
just like cr7
 jeanfredperez1631 mrbeast is better
bros grinding on the meat
looks like we need the nissan pdp and beast master 64 
your status looks like bad than fall of ottoman empire bro 
buddhism does not look at life as suffering  and not everyone has to die  this is the way and the way is eternal and not in danger of physical death 
honestly it s not that impressive that he passed you because all he does is give away money  that s why he has so many followers and subs  i m pretty sure if i gave random people tins of money i d have tons of followers too because they want my money
man i remember the first few amnesia video s and the content still feels the same great to still see you going
numbers are numbers dude and quiet
he said  close   if he got much more subs than it will have no problem
hey man  try reading the mystical city of god  i think it would definitely effect you in a great way 
more book reviews  the alchemist
do not worry senpai  i do not like the over the top crazy awesome things that mr  beast does so i will always stay fateful to you  never subscribe to mr  beast

  if you have a fear of loosing what you have then you re ultimately being controlled by it   hits different
who said that  who  who bro 
reminds me about the jedi
 alfonsvalentinbjurstrom3944 the greatest philosopher of all time who also wrote  this books love you  aka pewdipie
bro if you are quoting  at least get the spelling right  it is losing not loosing  loosing is something that is not tight 
losing  
everyone is a slave to something
mann you do need to put something in the title that let us me know it is a book review  i almost missed it 
he used you to get your subs
but pewdiepie  it is always there  atleast for me
dude why did he not make a congratulation for mrbeast but made one for a fucking bot channel t series

book review is great
i really hope you would learn about islam
you are the best content creator bro  forget about subscriber problems  stay chill okay 
you should read up on orthodox christianity  it is like if you cross buddhism with christianity
still relevant 
please pewds make more of these vids  philosophy is such an underrated topic with people and should be spread out and looked into more
damn feels i just read 6 books in 12 minutes lol
pewds  what is life  you should react to a video called  the meaning of life  by  muslim spoken words  
asking for a year and finally
even felix knew mr beast deserves having the most subs in youtube that dude advocacy is to help many people as he can  you might not know this but mr beast  is doing food pantry service and any other stuff that help homeless people people with needs every week 
mr beast is just more entertaining
come on bruh you even have your subscriber from africa imagine that bruh atleast you are not broke like me  whom am looking for capital to start a business

s ubs
this was one of my favorite pewdiepie vids  and i don t read often
when we will see you in youtube boxing 
dude  that s awesome that you re into philosophy  if you re down to read buddha s teachings then i would even more so expect you to read the teachings of christ in the four gospels  i think virtually everyone in the modern world should read the gospels  for  after all  jesus christ is one of  if not the most influential person to ever live on earth 
pew s wisdom at all  
lub you pewds  smile 
the books pewds recommended    in the buddha s words  bhikkhu bodhi  dalai lama    nicomachean ethics  aristotle    enchiridion  epictetus    the gay science  friedrich nietzsche    our mathematical universe  max tegmark 
pewdiepie has been stuck at 111m subs for over a year   youtube is rigged
me in my third trimester of pregnancy just  suffering  through all my cravings   
oldest youtuber   your a legend forever bro  
we need more of this  i have declared 
more boook reviews plsssssssss
we decided to save pewdiepie some time and we made a video of him wishing us merry christmas for 86400 times in 12 hours  enjoy 
i miss you

pewds talking about buddhism     my life is complete now

happy wheels pt 200 
                                   pewdiepie                            youtuber
i mean pewdiepie is not funny anymore  
cry baby  
mr beast ain t got shit on you still bro
yesterday i broke a real diamond and it left dents in my multytool hammer  but when i tried to break some bearing balls  i did not manage to break them and they left worse dents in my hammer multitool 
we are all waiting for pewdiepie jr  to lead the 9 years old army again  
felix you might be interested in masonic people 
you are a true legend
omg i love this self improvement books are so important i need to check this all
bully
it is ok no king rules forever pew
mrbeast is better  he would actually give me a shoutout 
i guess thinking on it  i ve been suffering my whole life because i allow things i can t control to truly tear at my heart  i feel inspired to attempt to change that  you really have always been there at some of my most trying times  thank you pewds 
but i do not know why you are getting more and more boring every day   sorry    you talk too much and your videos are very long
i want to thank you pewds for getting me into books  i have really started reading a lot  and i am suprised how banger they all are  like it is pretty fckn chill to just read a hour or two  and just dive into some stuff  you deem interesting that be  history  philosophy  war  stories  novels so on   i want to give a recommendation to a book i think you would enjoy a lot  empire of the summer moon it is a book about the comanches  how the most vile tribe in america rose to the most feared warriors  and fell  how history lessons  and movies have given a kind of twisted version of how settlers were the  villains  were in reality it is a more nuanced story than so  some crazy battles  and how insane the comanches were as warriors  i was blown away  and their tale  made me smile from awe  and sad for their fall   think you would enjoy it  good lucks 
he straight up wanted to get subs by letting a fuck ton of gamers who need constant stimulating listen to what a book says
and i must say that you are an extraordinary motivator for me and many people please pray that i can be as great as you  thankyou for present on this earth   my respect from indonesia   
i am glad that you have your own philosophy pewdiepie  but i just hope that you are not forcing your opinions on others  because  everything you say may not be the perfect philosophy  otherwise i think it is good for any youtuber to have his standards  it gives you a good boundary on what you should display your videos 
first t series  now mrbeast  what is the world coming to  
you are channel is boring bruh
your a public subscriber  
if you can care about subs can i borrow like 2 6 million of yours  
pidi ho una domanda ma chi ha fatto prima heppy weels tu o favij  non lo so  ma tu lo hai continuato lui no 
good job i am really retarded
you align alot with islam  i recommend you to study it  i suggest you start with the holy quran  thank me later  amazing video   
piewdie  traduction your videos pls  brasil and other linguages   voice traduction 
and the comment section fills with hindus and muslims and other guys
ironically the very first time i heard of mrbeast was when he had a video where he bought billboards that said  subscribe to pewdiepie 
i love this  pewds is real and authentic  you could of just checked bro  you had a wife  lol
this man will always be the king of youtube for me
mr beast better you
 if you have fear of losing what you have then you are ultimately being controlled by it 
i really enjoyed this video  greetings and support again my friend 
fuckkkk meee finallyyyyy have been waiting for another bookreview for agessss
don t worry i subin
read dostoevsky notes from the underground and make your brain even bigger
let mrbeast be on the top pewdiepie
i missed these book reviews  it is one of my favorite forms of content from pewds  numero uno  you are  pewds 
epictetus mentioned  like button pushed 
hi    
timestamp
i love this
going off the first point the book made  craving   suffering  as someone who has the mentality of  if i want to do it i will do it  that extends to cravings too  pewds says it never ends  but i can assure you if you go after the cravings enough  you eventually get bored and do not crave that anymore  so much co it no longer satisfies you or makes you want it  i have done this with a few things now and i am aiming to change my habit of  doing whatever tf i want or not doing something because i do not want    it is not as fun as it would seem
he cannot keep getting away with this 
pls do not speak unnecessary thinks about buddhism 
like when jeff bezos took over bill gates as richest man
noob noob noob noob pewdiepi
lol mrbeast wants everyone to sub to him  yet he has more subs lol
you should read about islam as well  
this is big news there is no way people won t be notified and make 2 3 accounts to sub to you
listening to felix being so passionate about philosophy is so enjoyable  every time i realise it is a book review i get so excited  wish pewds would do them more then once a year lol
he is a busy guy  how many books do you expect him to read  the quality of the books would probably suffer if he did it mote often
i thought he stopped doing these i am so glad i randomly clicked on this video
 jessicac8090 same
than  ok jk
i loved this lol more book reviews plz
lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize

i started reading in the words of buddha when you first  mentioned it years ago  sincerely  i never finished it  but i read past half of the book  now i got to go find out where i last placed that book and finish it 
cannot believe how much i needed absolutely chaotic summaries of books and philosophy interspersed with unhinged pronunciations  just makes my day  every time 
first and last one to have more than 100m subs
please  someone  list the books 
never mind i got the books     in the buddha s words x bhikkhu bodhi   the nicomachean ethics x aristotle   enchiridion x epictetus   the gay science x neitzsche   our mathematical universe x max tegmark   this book loves you x pewds 
      ncsoft                                                    in korea  people who play ncsoft games are considered gamblers  it induces users to cash without mercy at all

his english is getting worse
pewds do a video or live where you just read a book for us

i am going to listen but will not understand
can someone list all the books he showed  i am too lazy to watch the video again 
pewdiepie the former king of youtube you will be missed

book reviewwww

subscribe to pewdiepie to stop mrbeast 
subscribe to pewdiepie to stop mrbeast 
pewdiepie  i am 6 years old and you are older than my father
to be honest mr beast contents r far better than urs
i loved that part of your youtube phase when you recorded all those crazy horor games
because japan and stuff  you should read go rin no sho by miyamoto musashi  i found it interesting but that might just be me  nietzsche seems kind of like mahler  he is an acquired taste
imagine having 111 m followers getting surpassed and then having to read 5 books just to cope 
keep subscribe
 good or bad does not exist  it is something that we made up  i find it hard to believe he said that
felix  you are amazing   this was beautifully edited   your wise  yet amusing words  are wonderful  please keep doing book review  i strive for your growth 
if i had the choice to make someone the most subscribed that would be mrbeast  pewds was already half retired so i am happy someone really worthy took over the top 
                         
have you read aquinas  philosophy 
i thought he gone say  i have declared war
6 46 because it is hard to take something you never had 
please happy wheels 2001
bro became such a sad and boring adult 
lol  seems like self control and self sufficiency is a common theme in his favs  also interesting to note he gets in touch with his humanity feelings via processing logical text and concepts   i think the separation of being a scientist and a philosopher is a  mistake  because obviously being focused on just being a scientist has led to much greater scientific progress  but now its also just a corporation churning out  data  where is the direction  or what should we do with it  the attempts to rectify this by scientists  with a philosophical mindset  is lacking  we need to be trained both as a full fledged scientist and an actual philosopher like in the past 
do happy life man
just go buy more  we know you do lmao
mr beast passes pewds in subs  pewdiepie  these are my reasons for living  philosophy     in other news kelly clarkson s song  stronger  is experiencing a top 10 bump despite being old af
this is bad
pewds is my daddy
you are best than mr beast
remember mr beast is a team and pewdiepie is one person  so therefore he still has the most subs
hello sir have a good day  why would you do a video reaction to big ed and rose the  then and now  or the before and after waht ever you going to call it  because i love your reactions about their 90days fiance after two years  hoping you will recognice me sir thank you
pewds viewers are all grown now
pewdiepie no longer the most subs
yes have not got twitter or instagram 
          
sad men  
idc if mrbeast overtook felix pewds will always be the king of youtube influencing so many tubers including mrbeast
you may not be the king anymore but we will always remember you as a king
rip
do not sweat it pewds  mr  beast is literally the antichrist
id suggest you to read books on epicurean philosophy  you might really like it because i believe it would resonate with your current personality 
just be orthodox christian   
v
watching this 2 days later  mr beast is at 119 mil  like wow
we  dielive     
me pewdiepie  i have declared   this is the origin of suffering 
pewdiepie just handed to the torch   it is all going as planned  
pewdiepie cannot be compared to a youtuber with a big production  that s just unfair
you are still the most subbed individual creator   mr beast is a team
yoo
the uploads are slowly starting to grow farther apart  it s sad seeing an era come to an end
have you watched the merli series  it is an oversimplification of philosophy intertwined within a bit of a cheesy plot  but entertaining nonetheless
life
guy is cringe af  i do not know how he became the best
question for pew  will you never have to work again in your life thanks to youtube  might be stating the obvious
mr beast also has a team of like 100 people behind him lol  pewds is alone with maybe 4 others backing his channel  editing  subtitles etc  pewds will always be the  1 youtuber 
mrbeast said 300  people including contractor s and shit
wow  that ending   punches were thrown
i was there when he was shouting at the camera  now  he is even married  god dang
i thought he is going to go here talking about mrbeast but apparently he got all in religious mode
please add voice bahasa indonesia
hello poodi  i have just rewatched cry of fear
i love that you ve started reading a lot 
i mean it makes sense  mr beast is making content
my favorite book right now is the primal scream by arthur janov  if you are interested in interesting therapy and creating a new self or habitual sense of self 
wewe  dielive
is this the new world order they are talking about 
happy wheels 200 i wish jacksepticeye would go that far
first video i have watched from pewdiepie in a couple of years  wow i have missed out 
you are the best pewds <3
no  i do not think anyone with 100 000 000  100 million  subscribers would ever  delete their youtube account  so lucrative  thank you 
the english phrase is  slow burn  not  slow cook      i do not know why that made me laugh so much 
felix will be with us no matter what 
pewdiepie still great
cool story  where happy wheels 
2 11 that chocolate pizza was suffering
pewds is not funn to watch annymore
poor pewdie
read mere christianity by cs lewis
he slowly being remove from the internet  bye
you succumb
get this man some subs now 
eyeopening video  mostly because it shows pewdiepie s beliefs  i did not know them before lol 
dawned on me while felix finished the main quest line and started taking his side quests and retired  jimmy finally started on his main quest line and has finally caught up to the writer of the walkthrough  6 years ago this was a dream  now it is become a reality  gratz   
this is it felix  this is the video   
lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize  
pwediepie cool youth philosopher era
already read it 
lol
  we got popcorn  
i remember watching mr beast back when he had like 800 000 subs and now he made it to the top  its crazy but i think its awesome and well deserved 
i remember watching him back when his most prominent series was worst youtube intros back when he had maybe 40k  i never would have imagined him to get this big but holy shit does he deserve it  very happy for him  could not have happened to anyone better i am going to
 mmr lm i remember watching him when he had 10 subs
homeboy mr beast videos will never compare to pewdiepies sorry not sorry 
 cheeselord420 yea but i think they are both amazing youtubers though yk
 mmr lm haha i was watching during that era as well  i remember his first video where he donated 10k to a homeless man thinking he should do more lol
felix became big brain
the reason why he passed you is because his content is superior in dialogue  script  ideas  budget  epicness  cultural value  cultural importance  culturally and historically interesting  unlike you  he does not hide under a basement uploading kiddie content   edit  you are utterly b o r i n g also his editing is superior  in fact  even my editing is superior than yours  and before anybody says my content is inferior  i won a content to universal pictures and warner over my videos because my editing is superior and i used a lot from them  also i don t need youtube money  that s pa the tic
where is vlog
don t care  you re the og king of youtube and part of my growing up     keep doing what you love and have fun  
why is pewdiepie pushing budhism on children
wait was that a chocolate pizza 
 here are some books that will teach you about life and give you inner peace  after reading the books 2 38
can we make a philosophy with pewdiepie a thing
upload part 200 
do not retire
now that is a breakthrough  i decided to watch pewdiepie because i saw this name on mr  beast channel  somehow i never watched you before  awesome job  loved the video   the content you are sharing  read books  it s awesome 
0 30 in the buddha s words 3 20 nicomachean ethics 5 15 enchiridion 8 00 the gay science 9 55 our mathematical universe 11 35 this book loves you
was not prepared for a book review
pewdiepie iin your face mr beast passed you what a shame
i needed this list of book so bad today so thank you
the way i clicked on this vid and then checked mr beasts channel and bruh i was so shocked like huh  why am i so shocked i am like  
my favorite pdp content right here
 globalroot device condrv kernelconnect
copy it
pewdiepie has become a religious speaker
for the story of the buddha s life  all 80 years  i really recommend you to read the beautiful book old path white clouds  by thich nhat hanh  
wow your low
ok  balls review when 
i feel felix is one of those games protagonist who has finished the main story and happy now doing side quests  i found his channel back in 2013  in a way  him and everyone who were where for a long time have grown and changed as a person 
according to buddha the main because of suffering is actually ignorance  then comes desire  fear etc   but great video  i loved hearing about the books   
you re still on top pewds lol you always will be  like other people said  mr  beast does huge crazy productions that appeal to the algorithm whereas you have been by yourself and with marzia and sive  i haven t been watching all your videos so i do not know sive but i ve been here since the beginning  doing whatever you want to do really and you ve been the king of youtube forever  that s amazing man  you ll always be at the top in my book    
pls just read quran there is no better book in the hole universe
he passed you in subs but not hearts  
i am 14 and i am deep fix it
vash
ganshit
felix great message  but it s like a double edge sword  like accepting stuff is the way it is  one point is it doesn t bother you and because of that you most likely won t do anything to fix it or make better  then on the other hand it does bother you  then it puts initiative to fix  and change it so you don t have to accept it  like death because people don t want to die eventually we might be able to not die from age because of medicine and advancements  not accepting how things are is how we as people have advanced most of the time  you know 
i miss the good old days of pewdiepie with matsya like that one video the floor is lava
hey just tried your gfuel cherry flavor it was really good and gave me energy
have you read the bible felix 
never thought i would hear the guy from youtube wh re  w the wall of dicks  talk about reading nietzsche though
what do you have on your mustache 
just do more accounts and sub pew
10000
7
hi
hi
hi
hi
is that galaxy s22 ultra  by the way  i recommend you reading bible if you are so much into books  it will teach self control  how to react to any situation in you are life  has a lot of interesting stories  you can even find situations that will overlap with the ones we have  and last  actually not  but not least good for you are self development
hi
i do not know why you became famous you have literally nothing special not a talent nothing
guess who was the first to cross 100m  l
it is amazing to have a huge influencer to share their new found wisdom  straight up positivity and words of encouragement for younger generations to learn than just the toxic media they are usually fed  love you pewds  you are  character arc  is freaking beautiful  my guy  <3
love the book reviews 
thank you felix  it is amazing to see how much you have grown  while also kind of growing parallel to you i think many people would enjoy longer philosophy videos because it is very refreshing to see someone who is actually trying to truly appreciate philosophy 
 suffering is enlightenment  my ass  suffering is suffering  enlightment is enlightment  unless all is one  in which case there is no need to define anything 
har du l st tao enlight puh   do not know the english title  det  r taoism beskrivet av nalle puh     
its treason
presentation and editing of this video was perfect  
book reveiw
still a legend and still the first content creator to hit over 100mill subs 
felix do you know japanese  by the way hello from sweden hudiksvall
primero que habla espa old
anyone got a list created for the books 
dude s got depression
   
lame ass does not understand half of what he is saying but he is still based
you are super rich so i get just making natural content you want to do  but there is a reason his channel is growing so much consistently  i am still a pew fan but i have not seen a video in years that i enjoyed like the happywheel days 
i do not care who passes felix pewdiepie on sub counts  the will always be my  1 you tuber  other than the minecraft series and his content with sean jacksepticeye   cinnamontoastken  i prefer the content he releases now  i find it far more interesting 
all that i have taken from this video is that i should sleep on epic tetus  
i feel like he has been waiting for this day and i think he s finally glad it s here you will always be king any way
play high on life
save pew
 good and evil does not exist  stopped listening there 
mr beast is going to be mad he wants you to be ahead of him
maybe a dumb question  but do you guys think felix reads most books in english  or does he read some in swedish  just wondering 
digo que mrbeast puede llegar a ser mejor que varios yutubers
your trash 0 33
sounds like books are felix s acid trips
mr beast diss track 
pewdiepie is a shiftoker confirmed 
2 40  to me  this is really about self control  take control of your body  this really helped with my own problems in the past  really glad felix finally got over his incontinence issues  i am so proud of him 
69 likes  nice 
 incontinence issues  what is that 
 ocheonuh6788 just looked it up and it says   lack of voluntary control over urination or defecation   lol
 sebastiansoto9451  i did too  same  there was also a definition that was basically  lack of self control  but the dictionary i used also wrote this attached to it   dated 
i am being 10000000000  honest when typing this  i literally read this comment and listened to him say it word for word at the exact same time i reached this comment  it was timed perfectly and it wasn t done purposely i love when cool shit like that happens in life       
have you taken a look at the bible  felix  i recommend starting in the book of john 
the bible does not teach much philosophically  the parts i give credence to is when christ is actually professing his words as he is the true moralist among that group of clergy  i have read all religious texts  even jainism and excerpts from sikhism  and i can confidently say from also reading the books pewds presented that what he has teaches everything that is already contested and or shown in the christian holy text 
still never going to sub to him  due to hes kind of a dink  pewdiepie is more of an adult now  so i am staying  there i said it  lol
cool
ubgot killed bro
pewdiepie will always be the king of youtube in our heart  
you should read the holy quraan next 
everything in those books is good enough  i have read the ones he showed and the quraan   there is nothing more he could learn from the islamic holy text besides how to be a muslim  and he does not seem too keen on religion  with him being obsessed with modern shintoism 
my philosophy is pretty fked up  everyone dies and life is short so just make yourself happy  who cares
if you think of it long  without you he would v been 80m or something less
who cares about subs  honestly  it s all about legacy and impact 
he will always be the king of youtube in our hearts
enchiridion l  from adventure time 
i was really hoping he was going to say wealth fame and power 
mr beast is quite overhyped  he s not even entertaining lol
totally not biased
is it time for new song 
great video  i enjoyed it a lot  d  i am looking forward to read  nicomachean ethics  you arouse my interest in that topic and i am glad that i have watched this video 
good and bad is real your actions have consequences for everything whether its negative or positive  death is bad in the way it usually spreads a negative reaction 
but in nature  there is no such thing as good and bad  just  life  civilization creates morals to contest against that which hurts us   and i enjoy that we are mostly ethical creatures  hehe 
 we we dielive  pewdiepie 2022
book review  >>>>
both of aristotle s wives had their wisdom teeth taken out
that is what i was thinking
>watch pewdiepie all day i would if there were enough new videos v
bad fps lol
let s smash the pew s sub button
alucino q sentado en un silla con una luz mediocre contando lo q no se  pueda alcanzar tal barbaridad  ahora he podido entender q estamos a punto de la pr xima extinci n de la humanidad
give me vlog noob
i refused to subscribe to pewdiepie for so long because i never found any of the content interesting  but i like pewds the philosopher so i am now 1 in 111m  
it is not a prob  you are still gud  
so at what point are we going to have poods review the quran  
everything in those books is good enough  i have read the ones he showed and the quraan   there is nothing more he could learn from the islamic holy text besides how to be a muslim  and he does not seem too keen on religion  with him being obsessed with modern shintoism 
 reed walters it was a joke my guy  just a joke about how the first book was about budda  and yea i get the theme that he is going for
these are my favourite videos that he does
bro we need pewds to read indian philosophies  geeta 
i always want to read these type of books to open up my mind but i m afraid my reading comprehension isn t good enough to fully understand  
i suggest you read a book called the cabinet by kim un su there is an english translated version its a good weird book   maybe you would not like bases on the books you mentioned in the video but you should give it a shot 
pewdiepie may not be the number one anymore interms of subs  but he will be the number one reason why  those youtubers who started at the bottom and now has their own names 
isn t repetition for prayer 
        hello my   lovely  subscriber  you just got on my list  inbox me on telegram
i am tottaly  down for happy wheels part 200
great video thank you
your need a new content just more interested
pewdiepie is so baddddd
if you think about it  pewds is still number 1 solo creator  because at this point mrbeast has also become a company like channel
        hello my   lovely  subscriber  you just got on my list  inbox me on telegram
good night poods  thanks  i have got trouble sleeping 
pewds saw that mr beast passed him and didn t make a music video or video about it at all  he just blew our minds and goes on to tmmr  you are the king felix
mr beast did get pewdiepie millions of subs from that promotion stunt against t series
father and son relationship
 aerochalklate pewdiepie literally mentioned mr beast when he had 100 mil and mr beast had 20 mil  i think they both helped each other 
the t series rivalry was pretty fun while it lasted
its impossible to beat mrbeast  their videos have a way of entertaining and the quality is completely different  and let us not forget that pewdiepie had 30 million subscribers thanks to mrbeast  and trust me the songs had nothing to do with it  of those 30 million i say that at least 90  were made thanks to mrbeast  otherwise trust me that after less than 1 month pewdiepie would have already been surpassed by t series
please play the new rick and morty like game called  high on life  looks sooooo fun 
what about the holy bible  it will literally change your life
tell me more 
what about the words of god the quran
 javielinelpillin1598 watch a video about prophices the came true in islam
i am glad its at least another good person that took over in subs 
i love the book reviews  i learn a lot and it is interesting to find out that i have some similar opinions and beliefs with felix 
 live life good  do not live forever bad    buddhisism 
when rich people tell poor people  money does not make you happy  shut the fuck up pewds  even 10k right now would change my life  i guarantee you  being able to pay for my medical bills will make me extremely happy 
the phrase  money does not make you happy  has a double meaning  there are good and bad things  if you think about it  money may not give you happiness  but with that money you can pay for a therapist or a psychologist to help you
obviously money can make you happy  but being rich does not guarantee happiness
the endurance of pain ensures an appeal to the future that you will no longer feel it as much later  it is an imperative to have two sides of a coin  or else it would not be a coin at all   
read baudrillard simulacra and simulation
i love that kind of clickbait
a great life lesson from felix  but a side note i would like to add  do not mistake being impoverished as stoic lmao  it is not virtuous to be starving and struggling to survive  at least have your needs met before you start thinking about stoicism  poor people need help to get back on their feet and instead of glorifying their struggle it is better to help them if you are able to 
where is cho cho cho charles 
nietzsche is a legend
interesting book choices  i have read them too  except yours   and the mathematical universe 
what keeping from reading mine   
love how the swedish guy i used to watch play mind craft as a kid is now recommending me books
i have missed the book reviews 
you can catch up anytime big fan of mine

you do not even have views in videos  mrbeast have so much like 10 20 times more views in every video

this was inevitable  still sad to see
congratulations   lucky subscriber text me
pewdiepie is a youtuber who remains relevant even to my degree
if you are subbed to pewdiepie  
pewdiepie is still the  1 youtuber in asia and the  1 european youtuber 
really  i am pleased to hear that fan    
 user qc3dt9cl7c how can you be a scammer and still have the mind of a 4 year old 
because he is better then you
 
felix  i highly recommend russell brand s books  the dude has been through every stage of life of life imaginable and i think the two of you have a lot in common so i am sure you will appreciate his books
damn the books you read   umm the gps at 6 01 is korean
his mood says he have not took his corona vaccine yet  
pewdiepie is still the solo most subscribed youtuber 
the day finally came 
this is a man who became so good at what he does  that he got bored of doing it and decided that caring about it further would lead to an eternal struggle for some outlandish validation that simply does not exist for him anymore  kudos on nirvana  felix 
i second that  
 pianoreeves9611 do not read my name
more like he got so rich he did not need to care 
did you know buddhism came from hinduism it is tributary   you want the whole package read vedas 
that is like saying   did you know that christianity came from judaism  it is a tributary  you want the whole package  read the old testament  hahahahahah i am not making fun of you by the way  i like hinduism and buddhism  
 reed walters hey just to b clear i meant no disrespect this is hard truth i live in it by the way for me all these indic religions are same  there are no borders except due to the legal system i believe there is no hinduism buddhism jainism sikhism they are all an indian religion culture civilization religion is not the right word what i feel sad is that buddhism is an attractive package that has successfully packaged itself to the west successfully distancing itself from hinduism they r treated like two different religions having no common roots alzo what i meant was buddha never started buddism as a religion he was a hindu king siddhartha gautama i am not downplaying the gretness of buddhism iam merely presenting facts i meant in a broader sense that all religions born in india hinduism buddhism  sikhism jainism all share the same core values what i feel like is these religions are the extrapolation of certain core values found in hinduism to the extreme mildy extreme i e they focus on  certain  core values by that i also mean hinduism is not strict its very fliud i cannot explain it here its very complex and due to its fluidity many religions were born it is the truth man  y i said tributary was bcoz they literally branched out of hinduism no sugarcoat all indic religions believe we r the same hindus also believe in buddha we consider him one of the 10 avatars incarnations  of lord vishnu one of our trinity so i just mean all these religions are the same we are the same river of knowledge personally i feel like these religions are like drawing arrows from hinduism in different directions by the way hinduism is really complex it is a religion legally but also not a religion if you know what i mean 
well mr  beast once said that if his channel surpassed pewdiepie  he will deleted it  i guess he must have forgot
book review 
nah you look like you have not found true peace and you will not find it in any book except one 
i have this book loves you
but here in philippines  pewdiepie still  1  
nan
dead yucuber
been watching pewds since i was 15 years old  i ll be 29 in a couple months  that s 14 years and i still enjoy his videos so much
all the phases pewds went through   the edgy phase  the alcoholic phase  the gym bro phase  the philosopher phase
so  he is lived a normal adult life 
 nikki cb5zn do not read my name
minecraft phase
edgy phase supremacy
wait  i do those concurrently
you missed shy phase and then screaming phase at the start
forgot the racist phase
felix is an individual who managed to achieve financial freedom at a young age  he may not be a billionaire  but i think it is safe to assume that he could never work another day in his life and would still be able to maintain his current lifestyle without money ever being an issue  that being said  he seems to be genuinely curious about a wide array of subject matters   from philosophy  to science  fitness  history  psychology  sociology  etc etc and is afforded more time than most to explore new ideas and concepts being that he is not reliant on employment to make ends meet  i have always thought he comes across as well rounded and of above average intelligence  he seems to have grown a bit jaded in recent years  but i appreciate his often well reasoned and fair perspectives 
current status   weeb phase
 nate735 i am glad he did not get to the w0ke blue haired weirdo phase 
what about the among us phase
 nate735 he is not a racism 
 mrcheeto1006  racism 
he started as an og e boy
 nikki cb5zn nah i will never go by the alcoholic phase
he is the youtube musashi
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ 
 nikki cb5zn that is normal to you 
 nikki cb5zn no  you are suppose to be edgy when you are a teenager  not an adult  edgy adults being a common trope are quite recent
the epic character arc
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 you got me
a
 haichah terraria phase
 nikki cb5zn most adults do not mature enough to see the philosophy of many things in life that is why they are so selfish self centered and do not have the solutions to many of their problems also most adults do not workout have a fit life
do not forget about the floor phase
 nate735      
 chrisdawson1776 so people are either snowflakes or racist 
you forgot the floor phase flor gang  
 nate735   
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 l
the bridge phase
hajahajajajaja
what is up with people saying he suddenly became a neonazi i have been watching him for a decade and i have no idea what they are talking about
 nate735 that is the edgy phase
 miraclelnvoker you are probably one of those people that complains about something all the time but is always the one bringing it up in the first place
called character development
and i went through all of those phases as a teen thanks to this man
 lamarlovesjesus no
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 you realise you can no longer see names its just your  youtube handle so if your name was somthing like do not look at my pfp then we would not know
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 i am not not falling for this  i am 99 999999999999999999999999999999999  sure it is a rickroll
and we adored him every phase 
 donotreadmyprofilepic69  don t report as spam
the bridge phase
next the doomguy phase
racist phase
the anti semitic phase  
 nate735 what a clown
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 i can always see a rickroll coming
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 ok
 nate735 man do i love bridges
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 i will not
truely a renaissance man   kek
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 okay
it s a lifestyle now
i am the 6900th like
 nate735 everyone is racist  some people just hide it well
do not forget the racist phase 
 nate735 that was the edgy phase
pewds has reached nirvana

really happy you are doing more of this  it is really interesting to hear about philosophy  even at a basic understanding  because it takes a lot of the things i feel and ways i think and puts it into words so i can help understand myself and why i and othsrs think the way we do 
meanwhile t series with 230  million  
do not worry my brother

vj s  video jockeys  all need to disappear into obscurity forever with their bs  vj s become popular in the early 90 s around 30 years ago  unfortunately for us all this fad has come back to haunt society 
can you make a congratulation music like with t series but with mrbeast i think it will be fire and it will get alot of views 
day 7 of me asking pewds to stream again
i remember being 14 and seeing pewds book and wanting nothing more than to beg my parents to buy it for me
it was not until now that i would say the king has been dethroned  but mr beast deserves it  that being said  you deserved it for so long pewds  long live the king  
felix teaching me more than my philosophy professor

when i saw this under pewdiepie i almost cried
more pewdiepie philosophy class please 
you still have 111m  
surprise book review besto book review
have you read the book about the reformed orthodox rabbi bill clinton
make a diss video now
if you are into philosophy  you are into common sense  if you need a book of philosophy to understand common sense  then you do not have any common sense  point is these books are dumb  and if you need them to tell you what you should have already known  then you have no common sense 
who tf cares
oho intp vs entj hehehe
pewdiepie virou budista  infelizmente ele n o vai para o reino dos c us  
i am studying philosophy at university and i am glad that you have taken such an interest in this field  i am sorry for picking on you because maybe you treat it strictly as your hobby  and not something much more  nevertheless  it is difficult for me to stay neutral to how much you shorten such complex philosophical problems as stoicism  aristotelian ethics or nietzsche s philosophy  nietzsche s works are for the most part strongly interconnected  and taking out individual elements of it in isolation from the whole theory of masters and slaves  destruction of values  etc  is not the correct way of discussing it  what struck me most was when you started talking about something like  optimistic nihilism  when it is a very destructive idea that literally aims to create new values all the time without much moral consideration   genealogy of morals  was a book so racist  misogonic  sexist  etc  that it had to be censored in the third reich  aristotle s theory of virtues is also a complex problem about almost nothing has been said about what he wrote in the presented ethics  when it comes to stoicism  you also completely omitted its aspects related to emotions  which are not very comfortable for humans  for example  empathy in any form is absolutely undesirable  according to the stoic school  you should react to the death of a close family member the same way you would react to the death of a fly  i could multiply such shortcomings  in short  my main point here is this  i respect that you are interested in this and are promoting it this way  but for god s sake tell these people what the concepts you are presenting really are  philosophers are not saints  but people like everyone else  we want to argue and dispute with them  we can respect them  but it does not change the fact that each of the theories presented in your film has as many disadvantages as advantages  and i have not heard from you about the disadvantages of these theories at all  and there must be some  because if you agree with nietzsche s theory  then you cannot agree with aristotle s theory and vice versa  philosophy is a beautiful science  but it is absolutely not a simple science  but a very extensive one that gives a huge space for digression and discussion  thank you for doing this  maybe i am imbued with too much of an academic approach  i would love to talk to you about philosophy sometime  i am sure you have a lot of interesting things to say  and that is what i value most about this science  a wide opportunity to talk  argue and criticize the theory  which results in another theory  and so on  i am waiting for the next film  take care felix 
mhmm  philosophy is a state of internal and external debates  we read these texts to inform ourselves on new insights  not to gawk at them for everything we can get  i respect these philosophers  but you must come up with your own opinion on the matter  not just follow a singular text 
 reed walters i agree with you  my main point is that felix explains these concepts incredibly abbreviated to the point that  from my point of view  he says almost nothing about them  doing so is at least incorrect  the way in which aristotle s concept of virtue has been described could be compared to telling the plot of the lord of the rings without ever mentioning sauron  it just is not and never has been that simple 
guess you got to distrac mr beast right now
no way this man in married to an italian and said you might crave something better and better then showed a chocolate pizza as better than a margarita
felix you look high  it s ok i am too
wonderful
you ll always be remembered has the best yt and the first guy to hit 100m and your whole life is to entertain us that s why we all love you   but not in a sus way 
pewdiepie is the best legend in yt history and he will always be
after 5minutes i do not even know what i am listening anymore
the grandeur of human philosophy   
hello
lol funny pewds i liked this video yes   
you are the biggest youtuber and most subscribed both targeting different age categories you have fans who have been watching and following you for ages who look forward to you are videos even if it s just you talking lol love seeing you happy thank you for being urself and for sharing you are life with us even if you don t need to thank you   
              
                   
do subscriber count really matter  is not it all ultimately about the views  i mean  there is plenty channels with millions of subs that struggle to pass 40k views sometimes
while jimmy makes crazy and phenomenal content and his has a whole team and crew working around the clock to produce such great content  and it definitely deserves to be awarded  with that being said felix  you have never been a  production   it s always been you and sive  to amass the amount of followers you have from truly just you  is a mind blowing accomplishment and just know we will never forget that  we love you pewds
don t forget brad 
it s shit content   they trying so hard spending millions and barley breathe   it s junk
true mr beast is technically a team pewdiepie is a duo i bet mr beast barly helps edit his own vids
stefano was part of pewds crew though
scare pewdiepie
don t forget kapuzenwurm  
i hope they do a video together  passing down the crown as did smosh when they got taken over for the most subscribed  the more awkward the better  that way we can get more videos of poods laughing at other people s awkwardness just to recover lmao
310ml
 pgssns what about sven
fr a  
 it is always been you and brad 1 and 2  should have been the word 
not just him and sive  do not forget brad
his videos are the same every time  hes terrible
so from the comments i seen theirs 2 brads a stev and couple others that sounds like a team to me lol 
hey bro do not diss beast because he has a team  they are both good creators but pewdiepie is focusing more on his own audience and beast is growing his  they have no bad blood between each other and this is not a competition so don try to make it one 
 zebrasnot6819 hey bro i never said it was  i was stating how felix should feel extremely proud of his accomplishments for being a much smaller team in comparison to reach such a tremendous goal and following  i love jimmys content and i think what he s doing is next level  have a good day
 pgssns and barrel 
it is been over 3 years since pewdiepie entrusted mr beast with the task of reclaiming the crown of number 1  this is not a moment of loss or a moment to honor pewds for his past placement  this is a moment to celebrate and prepare for the coming battle  and our inevitable victory  if you are not aware of what exactly i mean  take a look at pewdiepie s  congratulations  video  where mr beast can be seen slow clapping at the end 
and tseries
do not forget fake marzia
both are important
 damiand8245 lies   he does infact help
but mostly pewds lol  i sive can eat later no  depends how long we ve all watch him ig
michael
so true man just a man and a camera and he amassed that amount of followers is an amazing achievement
history has made 
budism   do not buy anything
couch   stand on
mr beast trying to figure out his gmail pass cz now he has to delete that channel of his
the intro  
subcribe to pewdiepie
to be honest you are a dead channel now
he is retired
and how can you say its dead 111 million subscribers is dead to you  millions of views a video aswell
 billyc08 his channels dead not a lot of people watch him like before so nahh his channels dead 
 billyc08 you still play gta v and fortnite  bye kid this is the last comment you get from me  his channels dead by the way get used to it
 joehiggins9125 what are you on about
 billyc08 well  that was strange  hahahaha
 reed walters i mean you have got to agree his channel are not dead
 billyc08 for sure  i mean look at the numbers he is pulling 
we will miss you pewds  you did great things and hope you have a great life in your future endeavors  long live the pewds 
wait  he is not quitting though  just not number 1 anymore
 pharmannie do not read my name
 pharmannie felix quit grinding years ago  he is just coasting now  i am surprised he bothers to make videos at all  i suppose it is just an old habit at this point for him 
 1pcfredor perhaps he simply enjoys making them
 andreakotvanova perhaps  i am still surprised felix makes videos though 
i fucking love this channel  this was the list of books i needed to hear  that i no longer need to read to understand their benefit  thanks pewds 
 tex5796 ratio

read the holy quran next pewpiepie
everything in those books is good enough  i have read the ones he showed and the quraan   there is nothing more he could learn from the islamic holy text besides how to be a muslim  and he does not seem too keen on religion  with him being obsessed with modern shintoism 
he duplicates his subs the same way he duplicates his money

great video pewdiepie
hey don t let it get you down too much  you have always been the first to reach that milestone
ummm
impeccable commentary  
i m so confused  why is he telling us about books  4 15
it is just pewds that hit 111mills and mr beast is a crew
i was 8 watching this man  now i m 18 and its still the best
read  botchan  yet 
japanese thing content when

i think pewds confused happiness and joy here
how did pewdiepie lose so many subs  he was at 112m now 111m
he never was on 112m
i think pewdiepie should do dmt   i think he will get all the answers from the universe from the experience 
who is mr beast 
i was just about to find you are channel just to say mr beast has more subscribers then you now lol and this happened 
crying of happiness over book review being back
some of pewd subcriber is dead
dude mr beast surpassed you in subs with all his channels probably years ago but since quite a few subscribers overlap it did not count so yea
you should read rainbow painting great buddhism book
6 44 wait  he had legs    
i would love to start reading more philosophy books  they raise some interesting ideas
people watch beast for the same reason people gamble  the small chance of getting money  people watch pewds for the genuinely wholesome content 
when will you read the quran
not to lie but jimmy helped you with billboards and telling his own viewers to sub to you
i love mrbeast
not surprised that mr  beast passed you  your content is  
aoccdrnig to a rcheearch at an elingsh uinervtisy  it deosn t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod aeppar  the olny iprmoetnt tihng it taht the frist and lsat ltteers are in the rghit pclae

who is pewdiepie by the way 
the driving in japan bit is so real omggggg
        you just got on my list inbox me on telegram 
i actually really enjoyed this  thank you 
book review yes
it is probably stupid to make a book suggestion but  roadside picnic  by boris and arkady strugatsky is a novel i have read over and over since i was a teen  it is a sci fi novel by soviet authors making fun of capitalism  but it is very similar to the s t a l k e r games  it also has heavy philosophical themes in the form of human greed  research ethics  and the usage of modern technology 
mrbeast needs money to have more subscribers  he gives a lot of money of course he gets more but pewds have lot of subscriber through talent and sense of humor  does not need to pay anyone to subscribe on to him  i may not see all of pewds videos but i  stay a loyal subscriber  keep up the good work pewds  bro fist 
philosophy hour  12 mins  w pewds
i rate this video as the  best click bait video of the year 
but he cannot pass you in views on this video

one book i already read when felix said that will read it 
i am a buddhist  and i enjoy his view of buddhism and the book review  p s  we are not surpassed  we are just not a chill bro enjoying our life in warm blanket  
pewdiepie  please make more content such as this  i have a feeling you enjoy making this more but are afraid most do not care  you are wrong and if you are right still keep going 
this is a power move vid and i am cool w it
it s crazy i remeber  pewdiepie being such a big part of my childhood with his horror gameplays they were so funny   he s never stopped being one of the greatest
so a new war has begun  mr beast more like mr yeastinfection

looks like mr beast gaining 500k  subs everyday
pewdiepie was like a father to me
pure fire mate 
funny how mrbeast spent tons of money to protect pewd  1 sub from tseries now he is the one surpassed pewd more funny on how nothing can beat tseries 
felix should be the first person inducted to the youtube hall of fame    
should have done happy wheels pt 200
more book reviews please and thank you
hi  
just came back to this channel after years remember when i started watching him like late 2011 time is flying by
i have suffered for the past 10 000 years 
in parallel universe pewdiepie have 300million subs 
mr beast is literally funded by the occult   nwo lmao  go figure
what if my craving is watching pewdiepie 
what he said at 10 30 onwards struck me  it reminded me of that phrase or that description they have of the bible   the living word  now i don t know the actual meaning but i had always interpreted it as  words that transcend time and hold relevance today  that weirdly  conform to the modern day  which is a backwards thinking it s more accurate to say it speaks on the fundamentals of many of the basic life concepts which no matter how many extra things we add onto a situation the core of it remains the same  regardless of our excuses   my mother would also say   the bible is still being written  which i agree with if you consider it to be just a historical text of peoples interaction with god  which would then mean that we are all kind of authors of this  continued bible  and well what i mean to say is  pewdiepie has helped opened my eyes even as a christian to look into philosophies and the such  written by all sorts of people despite even of the proposed credibility and instead as he said try to understand the person to understand their work and maybe find like he did  great life lessons that can be used even a hundred years in the future   because  some things never change   and if you can appreciate that saying at its basest level i think we can help ourselves a lot and overcome information overload by appreciating that it s okay to not know every detail if you can understand it s root 
from gamer to philosopher
love ya man     1111 wishes
pewds 4 life
okay okay okay we need biiiieeech lasagna 2
i just want to flex that i was subcribed to mr beast when he had 6k and was uploading cod content hahahahahahah get on my level
 don t just give into your cravings   me who just ate two cinnamon rolls because i have no self control   
do not be upset even mrbeast have more subs  we still love you
yeah  book review 
it is time for mrbeast to beat t series  you should consider mrbeast as your accomplice  i guess 
distract time  
pewdiepie always have a special place in my heart  had been watching his horror video when i was still  studying

bro  make youtube rewind great again
pewds has gone from  i do not give a f   or  i do not care  to  i am sorry   i apologize  philosophy has really changed my man
mrbeast is far ahead than you
mr beast have hundred million views and you are 1m viewers that is why he stand up
mf arirstotle      
just admit it you are channel is now dead and you went through you are time as the best yt but mrbeast is just better
exactly what i m saying
hes buddist now 
you can subscribe to a doctrine without being a member of it  p
what s about t series    
we can all at least agree that t series having the most subs is bs  imagine if every phone in america subscribed to fox news upon sign in to youtube 
my craving is to not crave  wait a minute 
mrbeast is 666 in gematria
epictitis  
what about alan watts 
the body keeps the score pewds  why no  scared o 0 
i love books and learning its so cool that pewds vlogs are full of a bit of everything it heart warming stuff books gaming his colabs with cinnamonken  working out and family stuff just all around great content and i love that marcia has her privacy
pewds finished the main story now hes doing the side quests 
lucky you    congratulations   you ve been selected among my shortlisted winners this xmas    reach out    to claim prize

s ubs
w
bros got millions and still uses a computer camera and a 50 dollar mic
motherfucker though women had less teeth  maaaaaaannn that gooot me good            
bro read the qur an   may allah bless you bro
everything in those books is good enough  i have read the ones he showed and the quraan   there is nothing more he could learn from the islamic holy text besides how to be a muslim  and he does not seem too keen on religion  with him being obsessed with modern shintoism 
so sad
6 38    zeus  your son has returned  i bring the destruction of olympus   damn i know this too well since i play alot of god of war songs on the p i a n o 
you know you couldhave just read the quran
6 39    zoos  your son has returned  i bring the destruction of olympus   i know it s lame but can t help it since my shitty channel blows up by god of war footage 
f
jesus is the reasons for every season
t series win 231m subs
oof
ngl seems like a bit of a skill issue 
books are good  do not let the algorithm get you  discipline   freedom  
i prefer watching you talk about philosophy then watch mr  beast content for children anyway
the madman just clickbaited us into a book review centered on serious philosophical works
i do not know if it is intentional  but pewds makes being intelligent so trivial and uncool  like here are the greatest ideas of millennia  moving on  minecraft 
love you pewdiepie 
is this marzia kjellberg as a pianist  i like to imagine it is 
pewdiepie and mrbeast are both my favorites honestly 
my brain hurts
thank you 123mrtaco
he s making book reviews with his own touch and humor  that s so nice
book review>>>>>
sooo pewdiepie vs mr  beast 2023
      
will neuralink make you loose it all  
what a crazy journey its been  i came across your channel when it was at 4 million  found jimmy at around 500 000 when you were well past 40 million  we had le ep c run  stay awesome bros 
you still number 1 in ma heart poopeepie
3 44 that was funny ngl
would you get  a neuralink implant  
bro a rich snob has over passed our lord  the day has came for war and to make pewds  the true king  
1 23 wewe dielive
you is pewdiepie  do not try to be mrbeast
i was 32 when i started watching pewdiepie and now i am 10  
with me being a buddhist  this is actually kind of interesting hearing felix talk about it
pewdiepie is still the  1 mr beast is azing and deserves most subs but pewdiepie will never lose that status
no way    
pewdiepie is a legend  truly number 1 to all of us  <3
smash like  we don t care if you subscribe
our family often does not have enough to give presents on birthdays or christmas  and i have always wanted and needed a phone  but i thought that  there is more important things than  what i needed or wanted  so not to fall into the temptation of not wanting phones  i tried to stay away from knowing anything about them  it is been 5 years since i last had a phone  and this year i finally got one for birthday as a surprise  when people were asking me things about it  calling it a smartphone  i did not even know anything about it  i did not even know what a smartphone was and i felt a bit ashamed not going to lie  been calling it things we would call them back in the 2000 s instead  just felt like sharing this story here  because i found it so funny and stupid
bruh i do not even take notice of mr beast even being alive 
pewdiepie at 100mil  sub by literally talking to his camera in his room is impressive as fuck  mr beast literally has to spend a million dollars a video minimum  to achieve the same thing  both are impressive 
i always support this channel  
do not crying i am coming youtube and record broken
 user yu9qb6co6o  ok bro where to message
mr beast is better to be honest pewdiepie is just not good anymore
what if oewds made another book  would be cool
i never liked pewdiepie  back when he first started and was in a youtube war with toby turner  ever since then he just makes lame content everyday 
you should have done happy wheels part 200
next pewds video  last person to keep their hand on my computer gets my channel 
its time  for the mrbeast disstrack
just picked up a copy of the enchiridion  this is going to be a banger christmas present
haha 
                
read the quran
almost does not count  mrbeast is not really even a personal channel anymore  has like a 200 man team 
right
just do a podcast together   call it even  
damn  this guy still exists 
we need to get pewdiepie to 666m subs  he does not care  so we can do what ever we want to his subs  exept make them go down
he had 115m when editing now he has 119m that is insane
pewds is versatile 
mrbeast will avenge him by next surpassing tseries
mr beast is a smart man   he used pewds in the best time possible
y know what would get pewdiepie more subs  finishing the terraria playthrough  there is no way he is that clueless  lying is just a bad move 
i cannot believe i was not subscribed wtf
you need christ
damn  i cannot tell if that is a diss or a suggestion  hahahah
hey pewdiepie  would love to hear your take on nietzsche s concept on affirming the eternal recurrence  specifically as detailed in aphorism 341 from the gay science 
yo honestly prefer book review to money baiting mr b ast videos  this could change a lot of people s lives compared to watching a video about paying random people an absurd amount of money to do stuff
ngl this is pewdiepie in peak performance
what is a hundred years later pewdiepie is remembered as a philosopher who did youtube
i know the whole thing between you and india but i would highly recommend you to read a hindu text  the bhagwad geeta 
4mil is a small difference between you two
das ok
jesus loves you all repent of you are sins     
i am in a college religion class right now and my final is tomorrow  thank you for the recap in buddhism lol
i know this was a book review  but i love these philosophy based videos 
they just subbed to go the next piggly wiggly meet up    pewds for life 
hes sub is now 119mil  titan cry 
shut up i keep getting this crap i know you are not real
yesssssss ahhhhhhhhhhhh
see pewds searching for meaning in life  jesus is the life 
felix minecraft please  you need to play with frogs
make bitch lasagna part ii
damn in all my life i would not have expected pewdiepie to be talking to us about buddhist teachings man  as a buddhist this is amazing  i am sharing this to everyone i know for sure 
iirc  felix made a video about buddhism a while back  cannot remember the name though 
something tells me the reason behind you falling behind is because you have stopped doing gameplays
pewdiepie was still and always will be the first youtuber to hit 100mil
don give up  pewdiepie you can passed mrbeast never give up  pewdiepie will love you
you are the therapist i dindt know i needed
who are you 
you re losing relevance 
hey pewdiepie  since you like these type of thinking and reading about things that just making sense  why don t you look into islam   you can read about it might amaze you the number of things mentioned in the quran thousands of years ago are things science took time to discover 
pew die pie vc deveria coloca dublagem no seus v deos pois sou br sempre tiver curiosidade them ver seus v deos dublados
pewdiepie you ve been our favorite youtuber throughout the 2010 s and you have made our childhood and we respect you but now it s a new decade and mr  east is the best youtubers of 2020 s but you ll always be our favorite youtuber in our hearts and we should be proud of both of you
pewdiepie what happened man you used to play video games and then you went down hill what happened man
i am glad i am subbed to niether of you
really enjoying theese types of episodes and pewds looks more at peace glad to see it  
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
does this mean we re getting a mrbeast diss track 
just found out i am like 11  swedish
i love pew but i miss the old him when he unboxed mail and gaming with pewdiepie
i like mr  beast and am subscribed to him  but pewds will always be the greatest to me 
nietzsche was like the jordan peterson of the late 1800 s  
nice  nice  now go read the unabomber manifesto if you have not already 
dude pls play roblox
i will tell you what is not relevant  me dipping chocolate cookies in 3 8 fat milk and having the time of my life 
i tell you what  i am doing the same right at this moment  pimp  i got the wet towel and all 
men are born at a ratio of 105 to 100 women  therefore  yes  men have more teeth than women 
remember that cheap tiara the guys at smosh gave you when you passed them   maybe you should give that to jimmy now 
hello  elpepe es lo mejor del universo xd no me denuncies  el pepe es un meme latinoamericano  asi es  yo soy de latinoamerica  disculpa por perder tu tiempo
cute
we all knew this day would come  but it seems like yesterday we were in the fight against t series
bro  you r in another level of content creator  already in heaven
kids be like pewdiepie boring does not stimulate
i m beginning to think pewdiepie is just a depressed genius
depressed 
ic felix went from being embarrassed by his book to fully accepting it 
why do not you just scream the n word at him like you normally do  pewds 
what am i watching  
noooooooooo
i have not watched you before but mr beast is better than you
lmao do not compare he is retired now he does not gain any subs now lol  even mr beast loves him
imagine one day when pewds channel changed to an educational channel  talk about philosophy and science 
when you look at it you really fell off i mean 2 mill views a vid is a lot but you have over 100 million subs so compared to that it s not much
when you realize that this is the end of an era holy crap
remember that mrbeast was always the guy promoting pewdiepie and look at jimmy now
get rekt  imagine having less subs than mr  beast   couldn t be me
after watching this i would love to see you sit down and talk to jordan peterson  he just talked to andrew schultz and i thought that came way out of left field but after that conversation i think the two of you could have a very meaningful conversation that people would enjoy seeing 
i love book reviews
try jesus felix  the actual jesus and not the meme tv pastors preach
jesus was a moralist  akin to socrates in his approach to questioning  you do not need a pastor or a bible to teach you what he meant    all you need is the imperative mindset to understand how your decision could affect everyone around you in an ethical environment   i am not a christian by the way  i just like jesus a lot as a philosopher 
 reed walters i agree that jesus is moral  and following his lifestyle can make you morally stable  but while he was alive he didn t teach morality  he taught repentance of sin and looking to him for salvation  explicitly  christianity shouldn t be moralism   now i am a christian so i obviously would believe this    i encourage you to look into jesus as the true son of god as well  i also appreciate your comment greatly and that it wasn t divisive  i love pewdiepie  i ve always thought if i ever had the chance to share the true gospel of jesus christ with him  that he would at least be willing to hear  which i appreciate  and i make the distinction between real christianity and not the pastors on tv because they  for the most part  preach a shallow  more motivational religion and call it christian  but it totally isn t 
 anoblesteed1541 i used to be a christian actually  p the rest of my family unit still is  i am more so a pantheist  the universe is all one being  we are all god  than i am a monotheist  and from all the questions i have asked of other christians and the many times i read of what jesus proclaimed  i found him to be speaking of the imperative nature of morality in a society  even preaching about religion having no place in governance due to its contrary standings  would you say that he called himself truly the son of god or a son of god  he tells of us all being of his essence after all  p thanks for the comment back 
play choo choo charles
there s no way this wouldn t happen your just to boring now
have you read homo sapiens 
i will always be on pewds side 
love the videos  felix  keep it up 
why would does anyone watch either of these channels 
hey pewds  not sure if you have read or listened to any of alan watts but i find his work to be very interesting 
look  imagining watching pewd talks about philosophy abd buddhism  who would have thought of that a few years ago 
but you have 111k though look up what 111 mean
111k lmao it is 111 million  you kids cannot get it he was the god before but now retired after reaching his goals
ikik i just point it out because 111 has a meaning
random but stoicism is a strong survival trait for prisoners of war
cuz you got boring remember when you used to play horror games and be scared and funny  now you just complain and be a critic to everything 
w comment
cope harder
you are too randoom
mr beast is a want to be channel  thank you everyone who made mr beast famous  that dude is just a forcing host who made and used other people to build his carieer  as i said the manipulated channel  made by one guy but created from other humans  buying and using people for his own fame  pewdipie play games but mr beast plays with humans 
 
is there a way to just have them tie at number first forever  they both deserve it
good mrbeast this boring
loved these book review
i would literally love a video just felix talking in depth about a book or philosopher 
t series still has more subs than both of them just saying
sometimes the more you know can overwhelm a person or know too much  sometimes ignorant can be bliss   be safe and have fun everyone
happy wheels you say
pewdiepie needs to stop being gae do your job
nietszche my favorite philosopher  
pewdiepie s book review actually motivates me to read again  i bought our mathematical universe recently and start reading it
well maybe you should get up  get back on that gain and power and play high on life  you ll regain your popularity though that  come on play high on life please
cowardice  his channel is still there is not it
amazing video   this was truly needed for everyone to listen thanks pewds
miss 70ml 1  pew
bro has more subscribers than the total population of 93  of countries  and he is making book reviews  what a chad 
l stream
felix  do not use a gps  use google  you do not have to update your gps maps either  which are crap 
this is my favorite pewdiepie content
who is this guy  some unknown small youtuber 
thank you very much for this video  
da
happy wheels i have declared  
you will be always the biggest youtuber in our hearts 
kind of like conor mcgregor winning two belts  many others have and will also earn two belts  but he paved the way and he was the first 
holy shit  we have come full circle  pewds has matured 
thank you for not joking completely 
1   in the buddha s words  by bhikkhu bodhi   0 31 2   the nicomachean ethics  by aristotle   3 22 3   enchiridion  by epictetus   5 38 4   the gay science  by friedrich nietzsche   8 02 5   our mathematical universe  by max tegmark   9 57 6   this book loves you  by pewdiepie   11 37
i imagine pewdiepie is a lot upset about this than about the t series thing because mrbeast is a guy and not a huge corporation  if i am right they have probably worked together before and developed some respect  plus pewdiepie is lowkey youtube retired  he achieved everything he wanted and comes back when he feels like it  they can both be legends in youtube history
damn pewdiepie got him with the receipts
111m subscriber special  creates new religion
i like book review
i love how he s using his big platform to spread positive and like good information it s nice
so there are currently 7 million more 6 year olds than 19 year olds  which is why mrbeast has 7 million more subs than felix 
i played  getting over it  does that mean i love life 
the great reset  the war for the world by alex jones is the most eye opening read of the past decade  maybe century 
humbled 
happyghuru
the good old days
i have the buddhist works and i bought it because of you  
i love book reviews so much
because you so slow uncreative    nothing
nah you ll always be number one to us all
can t say i ve ever heard of either of you 
epic
are not no way mrbeast is deleting his channel
the secret trick  surpass him in doms
you did not tell us about quran pew
everything in those books is good enough  i have read the ones he showed and the quraan   there is nothing more he could learn from the islamic holy text besides how to be a muslim  and he does not seem too keen on religion  with him being obsessed with modern shintoism 
i find the idea of parallel universes super intriguing  it is what is called an ascientific idea  an idea that neither agrees nor disagrees with science  it is logically  and in some cases mathematically  possible  however it is also an untestable idea  in that we can never know whether or not it is true  barring some radical change in our understanding of fundamental physics  it is akin to religion though  as it can provide some with comfort  or others with the opposite  i personally am agnostic to the idea  but it is perfectly valid logically and mathematically to have a belief in it 
friedrich nietzsche came up with the  bermensch philosophy  this would become adopted by the nazis  as it called for a supreme race through genetic superiority  such a great philosopher  sarcasm  i studied this in my history of world architecture course  know your history before praising someone 
wait  he admited to having legs
pewds is still the best  he can use a huge clickbait like this to teach his audience useful life skills and a better outlook on the world  always be you pewds  
hard to say all that and then say  drink gfuel with this link 
never heard of either of them   
did he say pizza s better than burger      
you had a good run
s ubs
i think he achieved the art of not giving a flock
did not mr beast start a campaign some years ago to get more people to sub to pewds  kind of ironic
i do not subscribe to either of you two  so there 
women do actually have fewer teeth than men when analyzing populations on a large scale  aristotle was right
if good and bad do not exist  then hatler did nuttin wrong hey 
is he that dorky looking thumbs up guy i keep seeing 
felix you are starting to sound like jim carrey  
i miss pew s book reviews
beast lasagna beast lasagna
felix i am glad i understand have you ever seen zodiacs they work well sometimes its cool i love your work you work hard for 100mil  years and years of makeing videos happiness and understandable stuff yes  
good
if mr beast  just  passed pewdiepie in subs   then why does mr beast have 118m as literally right now i just checked  date is 12 13 22  and pewds has 111m as of the same date  did mr beast gain 7 million subs in 1 day or 1 week  bruhhhhhh 
yes he did mrbeast s channel growth is a different breed
nah where is the dis track pewds
now all you have to do it read the bible  start with john 
let us gooo book review
as one career crests driven by insatiable urgency another is left surfing back to the beach 
he has a very good video about nicomachaean ethics  if you are interested you can watch it 
pewdiepie will always be the top youtuber in my eyes regardless of sub counts 
nan
i am still trying to figure out wtf mr beast does but give away other people s money 
the pubg bridge
haha get rekt  
when the fuck did justin bieber get 111mil subs last time i seen his video it was at like 40mil
berserk book review when 
book review
it is weird how a lot of atheists turn to buddhism  i guess you can remove the god aspect with most of it still there  weird though
finally 
yesssssssssssss book review for life 
was this filmed on a phone 
we are all wainting the disstrack against mr  beast  do not we 
who is mr beast 
i recommend  be here now  by ram dass  if you enjoy that buddhism book that pewds recommended
bro took multiple weeks to even acknowledge mrbeast passing him in subs
hey  random question  what cellphone model does pewdiepie have 
b
b
scare pewds 2022  why didn t you move to america 
he still has all the subs in my heart
you always will be the best youtuber of the platform for all of us
who is this guy 
pewdiepie   gets passed in subs  mrbeast  easy dub pewdiepie   gets on trending talking about him being passed in subs  mrbeast  uhmmmm pewdiepie  pewdiepie will always prevail
you are supposed to make a diss track on mr beast
today mr beast is at 118 million 
bible review 
most religious holy books teach the same aspects of ethical imperatives  but buddhism and jainism have a differing socratic view on philosophy itself  i am not a part of any of these religions  i am just saying from a moral text perspective  you can understand what the bible teaches in a grander sense by just  questioning everything you do for others in how it might affect them and yourself in a good way 
mr beast best youtuber
mr beast is better than you pewdiepie
you always going to be the youtube king to be honest
bro you are sitting there and beast has to spend 1 4 million   for a video that get s 50 100mil  king  
have you read any of henry david thoreau s works  i think you would like walden or life in the woods  his logic was kind of like why would i pay for a train ticket that i would have to work all day to pay for when i can just walk that distance instead 
 mrbeast has taken over me in subscribers  but i have one simple trick up my sleeves  book review  meaning  it is not about numbers  its about legacy 
what if i crave self control 
thanks for sharing  i love to hear your take on different philosophies  more book review please 
make a  saying mr beast 1007363828263 times  video
pewdiepie look liek he from planet dearf
no mein kampf   not based 
wewe dielive
we knew this would happen eventually but in the end it dosent matters which has more subs
what is your favourite bridge mr  pewdiepies
the sad part is mr beast did not care to comment or even watch this i feel he has not sub to pewds
did anyone else click hoping for a diss track 
can we get all the book names pined in a comment  
watch his road to madness and mark my words as they are profecy
love you bro    
play happy wheels  <3
i m begging to see what s on your bookshelf and your thoughts on them
you pewdie
i love this video i love it so much
hey felix  though the odds you may see this is slim to none  i would like to recommend  a demon haunted world  by carl sagan  it tackles personal bias and promotes critical thinking  hope you like it 
i kind of wish we could get longer book review videos this is such a calming experience for me 
listen the thing is pewds did this on his own and no discredit to mr beast but he needed a whole team to do what he does and yes his passion and drive and grind is insane but still needed some help aling the way  same thing with the tseries thing  pewds you still the most dominate in my opinion 
1 secret trick up my sleeve  the n word 
should not have said the n word
eh i do not like books
i just want likes lol                                                               
bud  are you going to play high on life 
even though mrbeast passed you you are still the goat and you will still gain subscribers don t give up
jonieboi ser deg
noooo  what mrbeast is havings mor subskribers sven i   anyways have you hear about this book  
i love your book reviews and actually wish you went more in depth when talking about them  i would have loved to hear more about what you think of nietzsche 
great book review   i will look upon it later  meanwhile  maybe you should look at salus  floradix  it is liquid iron with vitamins  when you mix it with orange juice in the morning  it taste great 
finallly the time has come
i wanted another dis track  
jonieboi ser deg 
the thing about this is pewdiepie new mrbeast is going to pass them in subscribers  and he kind of wanted him to pass him  remember he did  he is semi retired mrbeast is not close  if pewds wanted to  stop making all videos he could   he doesn t have to work  another day in his  life so he s not really trying to grind everyday 
dude fell of anyways lmao
my next video  guy with a mustache
i will always love you felix
pewdiepie still the best youtuber
bruh t series has double pewdiepies subs 
t series is a music company  while pewdiepie mr beast are youtubers
epic video
pewdiepie   is not doing anything great to be honest like how mr beast does stuff he has like something unique but pewdiepie should retire as he just does not do anything much better than mr beast
petition for felix to open a philosophy youtube channel
yay i have been waiting for more book reveiw and philosophy vids

i m happy we re all growing up
wewedielive
v rd en kommentar till                                         
hoping to see more of your philosophy book reviews  i recently got into philosophy because of your older videos  so so interesting and enjoyable to read
this is giving me t series vs pewdiepie vibes and i am all here for it 
v rd en kommentar                                
what is this reggie 
i thought this video would be more interesting
i love me some book review  thank you felix  hopefully you will do more book review next year
epictiddies  i will make sure to add that to my book list
love it 
he said we we   
hi
lol i know you re not pewdiepie  
i do not sub to mrbeast  pewdiepie is the best   
pewdiepie really caught me lacking
dude chill and donate to poor  you are not gona take money with you after death
while i love buddhism  i disagree with the desire suffering thing  we have to remember at the end of the day that buddhism is a religion  it has been used to define the mentality and ideals of third world countries where desired things are almost impossible to obtain  is awesome to find these ideals in first world country millionaires  but awful if you expect poor people to not desire owning things  here is where we can take the modern view of spiritually where universal laws are applied and the law that rules the universe is expansion  and without desire  there will be no expansion 
pewdiepie and mrbeast are cool
noooo 
bro these principles you talked about are the very important principles in islam
mr beast teaming up with norway yayyy  faen ta  sverige
finally decided to come back to pewds after the bridge 
not sure if pewds has leaned into schopenhauer but i would feel he would appreciate his thoughts  i highly recommend  the wisdom of happiness  to anyone who wants to get started
 do not take my legs  says the man that does not have them in the first place
love one another
pewds dissing aristotle for not knowing how to count has to be one of the greatest moments of modern philosophy      i have declared
so you do not buy designer clothes anymore 
always our king of youtube   
i wrote one of my college essays based off one of your recommendations because i read it after you released your book review  you influenced my way of thinking in a way i m thankful for  that s why i feel like your book reviews are cool
hey felix  i recommend you to read the bhagavad gita  i promise it will change your life 
pew news update 
hi  i am luciano from brazil and i am here because jey  the anime man  talks about you 
bro please in you are newest upload please say emotional damage
pewdiepie start doing videos about some new horror games plz and do not stream them
please play minecraft this december also
pewdiepie has had a huge impact on my life  he was there when i was sad bored or even on the background  just want to say he was always there for us i just miss what i felt watching his videos
self control   pizza is in the oven and i ate the chocolate first
happy wheeels    
even though he decided to be making videos occasionally to enjoy his daily life instead  i am impressed that his vibes still can be felt  
why he not even got a 14
okay now i am a subscriber because i love philosophy 
like  try reading the gospels 
felix  i am not a gamer so i have never watched you for that  but for valuable content  after this video i am genuinely impressed  it is my second comment on yt and i am using it since the beginning  this book proves your value  each single one of them 
happy wheel
the f am i watching  i feel like i want to unsub
but actually its on fire
this man has such a reach and yet he wastes it  this is the evil of the world 
mrbeast is also a very good channel but you have a better background king
              
i really wish i clicked this video and learned the cravings suffering thing before i finished the entire bag of m m s
technically he did not  pewdiepie is solo with just an editor in the background meanwhile mrbeast has a full team  marketing  management  editors  friends  etc  pewdiepie is and remains  1 you cannot change my mind 
as a christian  i see buddha as essentially history s greatest psychologist more than a religious figure  big ups 
same take on the stoics
i was your video august 5 past
s ubs
another company surpasses one man in subs do not tell me mr beast is not a team of people  so pewds you still number 1 
no its  s ubs 
click bait done right 
an swedish youtuber we all love caring more than mr beast himself
i sell my account nama giveaway 2 million dollar  interesting 
team samsung    
mr beast 118m subscribers
does mrbeast still worship this guy
lol i do not even know mr beast
when did i see a portuguese  brazilian  audio track 
i mean your views get passed by  film theory and he doesn t have half the subscribers you have  i don t think your really that big anymore
booring
ill for sure read
always love you are book reviews felix  read some more of mustache man two or so years ago  interesting read    
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
what is a mrbeast 
who s going to start the pewdiepie book of the month club 
look  pewds  i am glad that you are happy and chill and at peace with life  but youtube does not have to be boring and stressful  we miss having fun with you  come back 
why do you have 111 mln subs like 5 years
i love him so much
he overtook 3 weeks ago
pewpiedie face look like he is sad
no worries king  you are forever our number one   
you cannot just tease us happy wheels 200  that is so out of pocket
i am going to subcsribe 
ok  you are an adult now 
pewdiepie has been on the same subs for a while
pewds read the meditations it s da philosophical bomb   
bro become a gamer not reader
nothing wrong with desire  it is called being value driven  stoicism detaches you from earthly values in an attempt to not feel emotional pain  stoicism is a fear based philosophy and the consequences of embracing it is that you cheat yourself out of amazing emotions like passion  ayn rand s objectivism will give you a philosophy to guide your life  she says our own happiness is the meaning of life  not to be confused with hedonistic pleasure but actual long term happiness  which requires one to use their reason  reason being the method of our survival as human beings  it is hard and forces you to be accountable for yourself  she boiled morality down to a science and shows us that it is objective  not subjective  or intrinsic  inherent in nature 
where is mrbeast s comment 
pewds got humbled by mr beast so hard he became a monk
i will take the happy wheels any day  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
mr  beast is trying too hard   it is so appalling
you should care about your subs man we got you where you are now felix  do not ever say that again you do care about how many subs you have cuz they can go away trust me we know you live in large now we know that you got a giant house and you got marcia and you are married and you are doing great but you got so many people through so many hard times in your past until you move to japan it started not focusing more on your funny games and comedy and so what but we still stick by you we are still sub to you so always care how many subs you have because they can go away 
the ending     shows all the development to then threaten mr beast with a promise 
7 26 some stoic philosophers may claim that good and bad are just some things we made up  but not marcus aurelius  marcus aurelius teaches that good and evil do exist  the universe that was created is ultimately good and that everything that happens is ultimately in the service of good  even evil was created for the sake of good  if there was no evil  it would not be possible to be good  death  malevolence  and suffering are according to nature  and what is according to nature is inherent to the universe  and the universe is ultimately good  so one should not be bothered by anything in the universe  and the universe as it exists is according to nature  the inferior things in the universe were created to serve the superior things  the non sentient things are meant to serve living creatures  and living creatures are meant to serve humans  and humans are meant to serve g d  for this is according to nature  this is a brief paraphrase of some of marcus aurelius s teachings 
play more horror games like you used to bring back fridays with pewdiepie bring back our felix our early felix when we first started watching you 12 years ago or 13 years ago god i do not even remember all i know is i have been watching you forever when you first before you met marcia when your accent was thick and you did not know that much english i miss those days right off the hot dog job and fairy job you know where you are really into pigtails and speedos  miss the old days with you 
hey you should make a health food video lol people need to hear how to eat healthy   
did you intentionally use a lower quality camera  you savage man you
did we need to say  sub to pewdiepie  or something
                                   mr beast                              
i genuinely enjoy your book reviews felix  going to note these books down  looking forward to the next book review   d
please please please keep doing these  as a person that wants to get into reading  these interest me greatly
you should read about islam i think you will find some concepts interesting
12 00 best ending
i really hope you talk about the gay science more in depth
now we need a diss track
i definitely need the first 2 books 
would have take the happy wheel video
ms beasts videos get more views than you 
so sorry dude  i hope you will comeback some day   
as long as andrew tate never surpasses pewdiepie in subs we will be fine 
shoutout stephano for showing felix the importance of philosophy
let us fucking gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i love book review
i will not be surprised if you already cried the whole day      
hey pewds  have you tried reading chesterton s orthodoxy  
should have done happy wheel ep 200
strange just how anticlimactic this moment feels  felix  who has been number 1 as a creator for so long  no longer isn t   and there s just a video of book review  and acceptance and wisdom in life   maybe testament to itself 
wewe dielive
who s mr beast  
epictetus  you missed out on a really good booby joke there
this is the best video on yt  do not judge a mf by his thumbnail
he is at the age where nordic men become extremely boring and nihilistic  it happens to all scandinavians
we all saw this coming  pewdiepie is still my fave 
 
  
read the bible  christ is king
selfish gene   richard dawkins is the best philosophical book  science is far more intellectual stimulating than pure speculation imho   sapiens and homo deus   yuval harari  fear and trembling   kierkeggard are good choices too 
why did not you link the books in the description ahhhh
tragedy
i think i recall mr beast not wanting to pass pewds in subs cuz he would be   overthrowing the king 
i subbed right now on different device for more support
pewds will always be a legend 
that is becauseeeee you do not play game anymore  
okay correct me if i am wrong but is this really the same guy who played pewduckpie and taught 9 year old the usage of dictionary 
money doesn t buy you happiness it but puts you in the parking lot of happiness
genius move  capture those book lovers to pull those subs back  we will win against mr beast 
he has 118m now
thank you for you inspiring video felix  i love your book reviews and philosophy videos  especially when you talk about buddhist concepts  also please do more japan vlogs    
as a person studying buddhism the first noble truth  life is suffering  is a mistranslation of what it actually means  it is dissatisfaction  the buddha live the life of the most lavish man and also lived the life of the poorest man who had nothing  he realized that you don t need everything in the world but you don t need nothing either  you just need what is necessary and learn to live in the moment and to live with life as it is  not what it could be and not what it has been
pewds is the next oprah
i am a woman and i was born without one of my bottom teeth  it simply never existed  i know of 2 other women with the same condition  maybe aristotle s wife had the same condition and he just never checked other woman lol
i just notice that i got clickbaited and watch the whole vid
this will change my life i guess
you talk too much
do you want him to explain a boom in a word
just a legend surpassing another legend in his old times
by desiring little  a poor man makes himself rich
yep  finally some quality content
it s ok pewds you still have 8 bil more views than him  but i m glad you have grown past these meaningless numbers
true
pewdiepie  i m going to purposely make a type in the title to make it seem like i don t care
imagine showing this video to mr beast when he started making videos
we we dielive
mr beasts videos are kind of boring and aimed at 10 year olds  how many videos can you make about people standing inside a circle or holding their hand on something until it gets boring
he deserves it too
rich lasagna  comming soon
i would recommend the book  the subtle art of not giving a fuck  its a book about happiness and  life in general
mr beast has earned 6 million subscribers since the thumbnail to this video was created  
no 
have you ever read any of the new testament  particularly the iconic  sermon on the mount  
and here i thought that pewds will be proud of mr beast passing him  and avenge his journey of defeating t series
pewlosophy
and  
hey felix  for the next book to read  i would recommend the bible  i don t know if you were brought up as a christian  or if you ve read it before  but a lot of times  people just read it because they were kind of forced by their parents  and so they form a sort of resentment and refusal to pay attention to what it says  i believe that you would get a lot out of it  if you decide to read it  i would recommend to read it as if it were true  and that it actually is written by god  that way  you can understand it better  a little introduction before  would be that the old testament contains all of the trials of the jews before the coming of christ  and how a world without god s sacrifice looked like  it might seem a little harsh at times  with all the sacrifices that it talks about  but if you continue to read through it  and read the old testament also  it makes it a lot more clearer  some good versions for the bible would be the esv  english standard version   or niv   new international version   they are a lot more simple to read compared to the king james version  but it talks about the exact same thing  you might actually be surprised after you read it on how much it talks about philosophy  god bless you 
also  a lot of people start with the new testament  that way you can make the connection between the old and the new in a different way  but it  doesn t really matter in which order you read it  prayer  is also something that might benefit you a lot  especially before reading the bible  prayer for understanding  if you actually start doing it  i would recommend to be sincere with your words  it might seem hard  a lot of times we think   i live pretty ok  i can t find things to pray for   but as you grow more while reading the bible  you start finding different things to pray for 
i recommend a book to beat all of those  the bible
really cool vid  all the books sound really interesting   but whenever i hear greek words and names pronounced in english  ex  eudaimonia  it makes cringe a bit as a greek lmao 
please read the qur an  
bro clickbaited us to give us a book review  
unsub from mr beast  unsub from mr beast  unsub from mr beast  unsub from mr beast  unsub from mr beast    but still watch all his videos
mr beats es mejor xd
i would like to invite you to read the quran 
6 59 honestly i am happy despite everything i have  i have no fear in losing anything because once you die you do not even have time to regret  walking around knowing i can just end and be a menace to society with no significance repercussion to me is great
buddhism is evil and off the occult 
read the quran
haven t watched for a long time but i m glad i came back at the right time  book review   
not a hater but pewds you are awesome and i personally do not like mr beast  feel like he gives away money for views
still my favorite youtuber  
read the quran
really  really recommend reading the power of now by eckhart tolle 
thanks for the recommadations  i will start with enchiridion by epictetus i think  it seems the most intersting to me  also  you may check quran  hadiths and muhammed s  pbuh  biography as well  to us muslims  muhammed is our idol and  philosopher  and islam is our way of life  for example  the things you mentionned you read in those books  are mentionned in islam as well so  i thought maybe you may find interest in the books i recommend for you  thanks again   
you do get more subs if you do more than sit on a chair playing games and watching stuff
i would really recommend reading the quran  it is very interesting pewds
112           
                       
my man done lost his mind  or found it i do not know how i feel 
we want happy wheels
i like this video   y 
lighten up pewds  read something funny like  the library of the unwritten  one review said that it is a tiered dark chocolate cake of a book  i am feasting on it now 
brilliant video  so glad i watched despite the clickbait lol
you fell off bro
finally booked review been ages  
mrbeast is nothing upto you you were the ledgend who had to come at this point alone    
dead channel with every vid 1m views lol miserable
that is a lot od views dude
those are such great recommendations 
pews we need more of these videos please
this man never lie
not really surprising  your recent content is rather bad or pretty much non existent  i am actually surprised people still watch you 
i think you forgot that cocomelon also passed you on subs
play amnesia again
end of an era guys 
good list  except for enchiridion  thinking fast and slow is another one i would like to add for books that could change your day to day
i was about to write a rather long comment  but i feel like saying   this is why i respect felix  is enough for me  i do not really care about the sub count stuff  i am talking about the whole video  mostly the books review
 
adventure time book
yes i need to stop my social media addiction        
felix seems confused on what life is and means  reading these books for answers he likes  study islam felix  study islam 
pewdiepie doesn t put any effort into vids anymore  that s why me beast passed you
sorry to say that  religion is looks like an empty stomach filling up with pretty colorful toxic gases  some of them really looking trouble and and blowing your mind like overdose drugs or some chemical substance that smell good but it destroy all of your inner organs and reach to your bones like cancer ond occupying your mind and thoughts for becoming a nonsense believer to live like a slave 
i love to know what you read 
press f to pay respects
i want mr beast to do a book review  to see if he is just a guy who just find out how to exploit the system or if he is  anything else really  i know he helped pewds to gain more subs in the past but all i care about is the character  and mr beast has nothing to offer to me except excitement  but i want to be inspired  i want to know his opinions  i want mr beast to help me get through some difficult times in life  without giving me his money  but i kind of already know i will not get that from him  so i just want to thank pewds for existing here  again 
maybe teeth fell more often from pregnancy breast feeding 
it is sad he overtook you just by throwing money at everything 
it is like that but mr beast engages with his fans and other people a lot more so there is more attention to his persona than felix kjelberg 
we love you pewds
you blinked so many times felix  you have no self control 
yet pewdiepie is still doing it basically by himself all these years  still the most impressive youtuber  i do not think anyone s youtube career will ever be as impressive as pewdiepie
i respect you felix  and i think you are a genuine person  i hope that you read the quran soon  it puts all the pieces together and it will satisfy your mind 
the devils book
ebat ya ahuel
this video and books that it cover is increasingly insightful  thank you for this felix because this video is quite pleasing and a delight to listen to and process
baba pewpew
pewd talk reminds me of andrew tate it is wise 
based felix   best felix
the bridge
pewdiepie  you are always the rank 1 youtuber  the new stuff does not matter because you started the popularity     
i see jimmy and felix as on the same team so they are both doing great 
honestly what a crazy achievement for mr beast i never would of thought i d see another youtuber surpass pewds in my lifetime
la alih ala allah
mmh yyaaa i think a fair mention could be the content   i do not sub to mr beast because of his overly american hype sort of media basically the amount of shit he buys and does for attention  that type of behaviour is interesting to children which are the main viewer income  
 toadtoad7200 and that child viewers make it possible for him to run his charity s like beast philantrophy etc
 would have
 abhinavrajsingh2881 the philanthropy exists to distract you from the bullshit
 toadtoad7200 it is the good type of attention he attracts
he paid his way to the top
 toadtoad7200 do not read my name
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 ok
i can now name for
 toadtoad7200 bro doesn t know what the phrase  helping people means
 user hw9dz5qo7j praise be to god 
 abhinavrajsingh2881 right 
 toadtoad7200 where do you think he gets philanthropy money 
i mean to be honest it is pretty naiive to not think that someone would eventually pass him assuming you are not in your late 90s  everything expands and grows constantly  and the way youtube is now is so much more different  that different types of content are way more popular now  it was going to happen and i am surprised it did not sooner
the day pewds stopped caring about his sub count is also the day sub count lost its meaning 
pewdiepie is goosiest
cope harder
felix play games man
sheeesh mrbeast now has 118m subs damn pewdiepie do be getting sent to the grave
the video we ve all been waiting for 
all i can say is i grew up with pewdiepie
mr  beast buys his views and subs  pewds earned them the hard way  screaming  and playing minecraft 
    
he is so brilliant edit thew for 1 2k likes
how did he pass you in s ubs 
buying subs probably
i love seeing you being in you are flop era  
what about the bible 
w
wen tibia gameplay
i mean you do fuck all he plays gta in real life 
the fact mr beast hasn t commented on this post just proves he used him for subs 
24h gone lol 
read the coran man
same
you know i have request if you want it you can try read alquran  it a lot interesting stuff about life and world in alquran  is the old book from the past and write a god through the prophet muhammad saw and the book never change by any people  you know should read that it about life  it about the past  it very educational and alot of how to be a good person or to behave good
you should read quran
glad i watched this  i have been looking for some book recommendations  so it is cool that you had some for us  goin through some stuff  so i am looking forward to a bit of philosophy 
i was 7 9 when i started watching pewdiepie and now i m 20 
mr beast  destroying material stuff  making people go through stupid shit for money  braindead videos  meanwhile pewdiepie  book review in his pc room   this speaks volumes i am going to
bich lasagna
mr beast was behind pewdiepie vs t series  the law of sowing and reaping  energy out energy in 
came when i was 13 and turning 23 this years  here s to 10 years
this video was an extreme spanking for mr  beast
be a muslim
elon musk lost his title of the richest man in the world 
when can we get the whiskey review back
mr  beast  spends millions on every video  has a whole ass company of people working with him  does not take time off  and eats lives and breathes 100  of his time to coming up with unique and extravagant video ideas  pewds  happy wheels go brrrrrrr
these books seem cool  but where to start  haha
l good
book review 
its good that mrbeast passed you he deserves it
 user re7qf1xf1x i am not falling for that scam
you should read the quran
0 22 is it bad i knew all these books from the blurred cover images except one  just to realize that is pewdiepies own book 
you are the anti beast  love it 
 user re7qf1xf1x scam ass bullshit
      
book mentioned  1 the buddhist world by john powers 2 nicomachean ethics by aristotle 3 enchiridion of epictetus by epictetus 4 the gay science by friedrich nietzsche 5 our mathematical universe  my quest for the ultimate nature of reality by max tegmark
mr  beast is a weird  he just gives money to his old school bullies in somewhere bumfuck methville in america  mr  beast is completely ignorant of the world  he is  like a stereotypical american  from which state kfc comes from   
do you believe those videos are real  lol they are scripted like a movie  those participants in his videos are good actors
 congress 2024 not at all 
let us fucking go
i feel ya on getting into philosophy when it wasn t taught in school  and i feel ya on all the over saturation of information these days 
please make a video about captain kori and direct your friends to him  the quatering and other smaller channels have made videos about him  he is in palliative care after having two heart transplants   he is in end of life care now  and his goal was to have 100k subs but i know with your help you can make this young man s wildest dreams come true and more before his time comes  be his christmas miracle please 
uuuh i want that book  boom suffering 
can t find my book  boom not happiness 
do not worry someone will probably pass him eventually
i loveee bookkreviewss
the simp king has been dethroned 
look who is talking about   do not care about subs    
happy wheels episode 200 pls
i like the facts that felix goes from the most subscribe content creator in the world to the most wisest one   please pin my comment  
i would suggest you to read sadhguru s inner engineering
thanks pewds  you made me realize that i am suffering and that i should probably go read a book
where is the mrbeast distrack
i usually get my daily dose of philosophy from watching educational videos on youtube  i would rather watch a 30 min video explaining to me the general gist of it rather than read a 20h long book  should i switch to books 
it is obvious that most viewers here have aged with pewds  some join pewds and his new lifestyle but younger audiences  myself included  are respectfully becoming  uninterested in his content because our energy does not match his anymore
do not wory lifetime supporter  collab with pubg mobile pls
is that bandicam felix 
does anyone else remember 12 days of drugs from pewdiepie  i want another 12 days from pewdiepie this year
i am going to call it first  felix fixing to sell almost everything he owns and live minimalist for the rest of his life   
i hope i get a random money sent to my debit card      
hapoy wheels man always happy wheels
do some gaming broo
pewdie is not funny anymore now is just a poor old man trying to connect with his audience swearing to people  ike t serie yes because
damn that is a big ass pimple
i suffer every day because i have a tumor sk i must be doing something right lmaooo
even if he has more subs  it will never be as good as your input into the world  i love you dawg  
he needs copium to stay alive after this because he could not cope   
these books are great  the reduction of suffering  the pursuit of enlightenment  virtue  and happiness  but enlightenment for a divine aspect cannot be found in the self or anything in our physical world  even secularly  the bible has such a wealth of information on these topics  it is the world s most influential book of all time for a reason and has shaped the foundations of our modern world  i implore you to not sleep in it 
damn pewdiepie has died i feel you  damn to stoop this low
is it just me or someone else is waiting for mrbeast to comment on this video as well
no matter who overtakes you   you will always be my number 1
pewds 30 year old wisdom is coming out 
i love s ubs
i notice pewdiepie has an aversion to christianity  i see sadness in his eyes as he tries to find meaning and gets distracted by the ridiculous notion that there are multiple universes 
never even heard of mr beast 
s ubs
where is the brigde
its so sad that youtube always shadow banning pewdiepie  i think his the priority on team youtube to shadow banned everday  lame youtube team
i recommend reading the quran for the next book review
nooo happy pt 200 you should shut your boii up
that thumbnail has me deceased  
pewdsssss  still number one 
i am buddhist and i can confirm that carving a burger is suffering
i am a buddhist and i hope pewdiepie will lead his life to nirwana  enlightenment  good luck       
floor gang assemble
so glad he does not recommend mainstream books  omw to read all of them
two more hours  mrbeast
the craving   suffering is so true  had an addiction to something once  i wanted to quit but the more i do it the more i do not stop even though i do not enjoy it anymore  thanks pewds for the reminder 
mr beast apparently is a fake pewdiepie fan  otherwise he would have been here and had some words for pewdiepie  but i guess now he is too big to care maintain his fakeness 
i like sponge cake
yay book review is back
when i started watching this video i just wanted to watch a video  now i want a burger and a pizza  the suffering
as a buddhist  i am proud of you  
love to see felix kjellberg collabs with pewdiepie one day

bro iv been subbed for 10 years
youtube is pay to win
read the quran  the most interesting book  with scientific backing and has all the answers  islam is the perfect way of living 
mr beast beef please
bro how did someone who tortured a sheep in a game for hours enlighten me 
now its time to take a look on quran maybe the quran will give you a good explination about what is good and what is bad
i wish you read the holy quran oneday <3
this book loves you  still my favorite book  
copium
aj
well  that is mrbeast for ya  but you cannot change the fact that pewdiepie was the first one to hit 100 million subscribers
no t series 
10 years of watching him and he never fails to make me genuinely laugh  
i hope you are joking with that pfp lmao
i hope you are being ironic with that pfp lmao
hope you are kidding with that pfp
i hope i knew about your pfp too
i hope your taking the piss with that profile pic
you all really shitting yourselfs over a pfp i made two years ago  
i hope your pfp aren t true 
 arima devil that i am pansexual  how does that effect you in any way  move on kid and get over yourself
 buggyateabug i am stir fry potsexual hello
 darthsidious8926 the pots are just so   
 buggyateabug i hope you have a dad using that type of pfp
what does it mean
 iamnisc it means nothing but people like to make fun of people who have pfp like this because the people who have these type of pfp get triggered and mad sooo fast  
people are just too conservative  too much focused on what people want to do or how they feel  do pansexual or non binary people hurt you  no so what
 iamnisc if you are talking about the colors in my pfp it means i am pansexual which means i can be attracted to anyone no matter what gender they identify with
these comments suck  it more the profile pic comments  they re just petty and make assumptions based on a flag just because someone with a flag  got triggered     they really need to get a life because there are better jokes to be made 
 buggyateabug true i used to be so negative like these guy who are for example whining about your pfp  i grew up and am now completely the opposite of what i was  i also notice that more people are becoming more open to lgbt  yes there is still a lot of hate out there but let us not bow down to it
 emileponcelet3439 exactly  i am glad you were able to find a clearer mindset  i am proud of you for making that step  
 buggyateabugthen nothing seems to be wrong here  why are others laughing
 iamnisc because they think they are hurting me  people like to make fun of things they do not understand and they like to push negative emotions into it  it is a psychological thing that i can never understand  but it could also be the behavior they learned from their parent s 
 buggyateabug that is nothing to worry about
 iamnisc true  
any sri lankans  
good old book review  thank you 
pewdiepie podcast when 
come on happy wheeels
if hogwarts simply had a philosophy class about stoicism  voldemort might never have turned evil because he would not be afraid to die 
anyone made a list of the books he stated in the video 
if mr  beast overtaking him in subscribers is what is going to have pewdiepie bring book review back  then i am all for it 
mr beast got 3 m subs in 21 hours and pewdiepie got none
should run a campaign like f tseries but with mr beast instead
so many simping prewds fans  go read the books and live your mom
most of beast s subs are bots lol he even said it  
  mr beasts per video gets 20 m   views and pewdiepie  
even if mrbeast passed you on subs you are still the g o a t  of youtube for me and mrbeast is for me the second g o a t 
crave   pewds playing koto  also  so glad that nicomachean ethics is on here  i had to read it for my philosophy course and loved it 
mr beast king
thing is  pewds is still the highest solo act  beast and everyone else are on larger scales
t sieres 
 
you didn t have to throw money at people to get tons of views  kudos 
what legs  felix  < <
          
book list  1  in the buddha s world  bhikkhu bodhi  2  nicomachean ethics  aristotle  3  epictetus enchiridion 4  friedrich nietzsche   the gay science  5  max tegmark   our mathematical universe  6  this book loves you   pewdiepie
deez
i wish pewds could read quran
maybe mr  beast can beat your greatest enemy  t series 
it is already 100 million subscribers gap
do the srimad bhagavad gita review and your understandings 
i totally relate with this coping monologue  xd
where the diss at 
pewdiepie is the most humble person he knows
bbb books no pls
felix read zen and the art of motocycle maintenance
you ll always be number one in our hearts  pewds 
sad  
sad  
wow no booklist or timestamps from a comment is surreal 
  o
mr beast is now at 118 mill oof
 
i just love that so many comments are phrased in a way that sounds like pewdiepie died the moment mrbeast passed him in subscribers or that pewd s channel is dead  it is just so funny to me  anyways  rip poodyepi you will be missed   in the arms of the angels 
i have no idea who mr bees is  i know he went to joe rogan  but i skipped that one
i got a mr beast honey add on this haha
read the bible next    
no hate but pewdiepie has definitely transcended christianity  if someone has had arguably one of the most interesting explosion of fame coming from his passion of creating videos and maintained it for over a decade without jesus  he will never buy into it 
he is atheist  buddhism is an ideology  it is not a religion  atheism and buddhism is same
 jamesbradley4329 how can you actually believe that a simple human can transcend god himself  man is weak and vulnerable without god  maybe pewds will never find christ  but it s foolish to believe pewdiepie is indestructible  god created him  and god will take him from this life as well  pewds will face his creator some day whether he likes it or not  just saying  an open mind goes a long way  so giving the bible a chance doesn t seem sooooooo scary 
 aice2313 dude  i don t think you understand how hard it is to get into christianity without one of 2 things  growing up with christian parents  or tragedy  trying to convince yourself that  gods will  is responsible for your success when you know damn well your passion is responsible  isn t very convincing  nope sorry pewdiepie  all your hard work  dedication and passion didn t do anything  gods will did it all  tf 
hello pudidi
i want to see pewds read and review bhagavat gita
your the first get 100 subscribers
myanmar has internet  
so 
waiting for the non diss track song by pewds about mr beast
bboookkkkk rrreeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvviiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwww
i am so happy to see pewds talking about buddhism  respect
more   book   review also  you should read about string theory
as a fan of both  it is just fun   from korean fan 
aristotel s wife missed some teeth and to cope he proclaimed it the normal 
book review
did he declare 
can we just appreciate the time and effort that pewdiepie puts into his book reviews 
la alih ala allah
ok
it is time for you to read the entire dictionary in one sitting
lol
i just unsubscribed from him
you stuck at 111 millions subs but that is a funni number so that is fine
i was picking my nose when pewdiepie took a picture  scared the shit out of me
i i am both a mr beast subscriber and a pewdipie subscriber and by the way does not mr beast call you a king and he helped you beat t series in the subscriber war 
as a greek i am dying with the pronunciation
alternate title  i put mrbeast in the title for views and talked about books for 12 minutes straight 
i liked the video 10 seconds in  that intro was 
      
pews we miss your vlogs  
phd student in physics here  do not take everything tegmark says as truly scientific  his claims are hugely controversial in scientific circles  if you want to read physics and philosophy  try existential physics by sabine hossenfelder or the big picture by sean carroll
don t think mr beast even qualifies as a  solo youtuber  at this point  just like t series 
f
you need jesus pick up the bible   stop the ignorance
to be honest i think pewdiepie can still fight mrbeast in subs by making an intense content like making the tallest pp tower 
no shit    in 21 hours mr beast got 3m subs and pewdiepie got none
wow
do happy wheels part 200
mr beast videos way more entertaining sorry pewdie
1   0 28  in the buddha s words  2   3 21  the nicomechean ethics  3   5 37  enchoridion  4   8 01  the gay science  5   9 55  the mathematical universe  6   11 36  this book loves you

the craving ends when you buy a house in japan

pewdiepie will always be the number one youtuber anyway so it doesn t matter
its more efdaimonia
mr beast deletes his channel  pewdiepie its a joke  mrbeast 
5 28 did max gilardy predict pewdiepie

because why not 
so tell me now why you subscribe to mr beast channel 
 samuraj7209 cannot tell because i do not
ight i guess i will sub i do not know why i am not subbed also
i love book reviews   buddhism is definitely a topic i wanted to explore more   pewds is inspiring as always
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
they added the enchiridion from adventure time to real life

nc book review
keep going felix  no matter what
noob
t series has 200 million subs
i would give niche hands
we we dielive
i have to say  i look forward to pewd s rare book reviews more than most other things on youtube
this is what we want pewdiepie giving philosophy lessons   yesss   
i ve noticed you have been reading books on other cultures and religions as well as a bunch of philosophy books i wonder what your take is about the bible obviously i m assuming you have read from out of curiosity keep up the good work hope to see more videos like this
do not worry your views 
karma is a bitch bro
sry kid
book review
i really like book reviews  if it is possible please make this a monthly item  even if it is just one book  thanks felix 
f  pewdiepae is dead
i think happy is when you live at that moment  you feel calm  graceful and think positive  there is a reason why this is happen and it must be developing and empowering me 
to be reading those books  is something i will but take time and effort to 
thanks
felix you are still the king of youtube for me
i always enjoy these book reviews i use to read all the time and at some point lost my thing for it but listening to peds talk about his own interpretation on these books reminds me of the joy of reading
you have a good life but at what cost  subs
pewdiepie you still remain the best  this is so refreshing and realistic  thank you for posting this  getting those first 1 000 subscribers and 4 000 watch hours seems so far away for me right now  but with each video  i am getting a little closer to that goal  it will take a lot of time  patience  and consistency  but i cannot wait to have that feeling of getting to where you guys are someday  so cool 
you have not gotten a mil in like a year
to me pewds is still the king of stupidity  and i just love him     
hey felix  i have a book recommendation for you   it is called al qur an  it is the most read   memorised book on earth  it challenges you to think about things which should be thought about  i am 100  certain that if anybody reads it will change their life  embrace yourselves also it is an humble request to all   
what do you do for the community you do not do s  all you just play games make weird videos do not be jealous of mr beast you are just jealous
this is pewds asking for help  he is clearly depressed  you have been warned 
legend
pewdiepie i reminded you that in twitter level predator exposed video
6 55 take my legs boom jokes on you i am pewdiepie  i do not have legs 
dissing an entire country to discussing budhism  what a full circle 
he literally does stuff that i thought youtube would never dream of having it is hard to compete with honestly
pewds  you should definitely try the qur an 
pewdiepie  name sounds familiar  i think mr  beast mentioned him in a video once
pewdiepie is getting a bit too boring these day anyway
still number 1 for me
felix  can i please recommend 3 books for you  1  the last hours of ancient sunlight  by thom hartman  2  the human story  by james c  davis 3  fingerprints of the gods  by graham hancock  a good overview of who we are  where we have come from and why we are stuck there  thanks for the post 
read the quran i am sure you will like it
lol
 whiteking8341 why lol
this must be hard for him  
try read quran so many answers for the meaning of life and more 
good he s better than you
mr beast actually tweet that    i did not expecting that  
pewdiepie it does not matter who has more subs then you you are still the most legend youtuber in history and you will stay that and    barrel   
the scientific one looks pretty cool
buddhism is pretty intersting not going to lie
keep doing this pewds
as an optimistic nihilist who has never actually read most of nietzsche s work  i was both enthusiastic and humbled hearing that his overall goal with his philosophy was about overcoming nihilism 
mr beast is a cia asset  pewdiepie is the truth and the light 
i came back to my roots for the because  we must keep pewdiepie the youtube top g
felix  your right eye is losing pupil  and th eiris looks like its taking over  you good brotha  maybe a camera  light trick
he 118mn mr  beast
you re still number onee for us pwedss           
this was great
felix is a fcking chad 
trash jokes  
so people just forgot this dude is a straight up racist 
bro  move on  that is 7 years ago 
nooooooooooooo wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  although both of you  > gud 
minecraft
the pewdiepie ethics lesson was the last thing i expected from 2022 and also the most pleasant surprise  i m here for this pewdiepie philosophy book club  add these titles to your wishlist folks 
you do not have a voice track therefore  i cannot understand english
i highly reccomend you to read the subtle art of not giving a f ck pewds  it talks about the same topics in a different perspective and more modern
pewds  do not watch my video me   intense keyboard noises
yep  inner peace it is  
why does it feel like he is that one chill teacher that is actually  down with the kids    wish we had teachers like pewds lol
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
all these  book reviews but you never read the book that has been memorized by millions of people  the qur an 
    
blub
 
uiui sustei
tradu  o de seus v deos   a chave para o sucesso usa a cabe a pewdidpie
thank you pewds for epic book review
one of my own personal philosophy is that even if owned the whole universe  it would be useless  i cannot even use most of it  heck i cannot even use a steam playlist of 40 games  the happiness you feel is diluted by the spoil of choice and competing substance they provide   i actually enjoy modding a game more than playing it  making 1 game infinitely permutable 
who the fuck is mrbeast 
pewds is one of the legends out there  that always help me feel entertained watching his videos
la alih ala allah
he is truly one of the youtubers of all time
you should make gaming videos more  that is how you got to 110 mill subs in the first place
streets definitely need more philosophy talk from you
love this book reviews always happy when a new one is out 
me watching this while eating a giant chocolate pizza  
how about giving the holy quran a try 
i love how felix became this matured that he will just focus and do the things he wants to do and needed to do because that is life 
search vortexedit
hes lost and aimless its why he started drinking in the first place dude been with the same chick no kids wasting time living an empty life with no value rejecting christianity but on here talking about budhism as a swede looking like a knob
 sinancengiz4834 do not read my name
 donotreadmyprofilepic69 do not spam my phone
t series
mrbeast made 3mil subs in 19 hours  0
                                                                                                chicken                                                                            
great video pewds  for me stoicism has  helped  me the most i would say  but like you said it is very popular today after all  all the other books are great i would personally add 48 laws of power by robert green to the list 
maybe old age is to blame 
this is a really good series do not stop this series 
ily zaddy felix   
remember that pewdiepie s channel mostly works in a small team  while mrbeast s content usually involves large group of people  
humour  101   
                 
mr beats who is that clown 
pewds is going to be the number one from 2010 era
i almost didn t click because of the title  i finally clicked and omg it s book review can t be happier right now  felix i know your were asking what kind of content we wanted to see  i was thinking about getting a tattoo and i know you have a lot  could you maybe do a video showing them  i would love to hear you re thoughts on tattoos you being the epic philosopher also would love to see all the silly tattoos would just be a lot of fun  
 do not sleep on epictetus  is now my new favorite quote
i live by this every day to the best of my ability  currently studing civil engineering  master of science in engineering physics which is pretty much a theoretical physicist in swedish standards at least  and stoicism  among other things  has been hugely helpful to not go insane from all of the studying 
i was thinking more like the harry potter books or something  i took philosophy in university and have not touched it since
while pewdiepie s reign is over  he will still be remembered as a youtube legend 
0 31 ngl i thought he said  the anthology of the pelicans 
they phased out pewdz because of shorts 
pewds will be always number one to me
 pewdiepie please read the quran and give it a shot
i worry that for many people  this will be the last pewdiepie video they ever watch  i doubt it will for me  but for most  probably 
you cannot compare these 2  pewdiepie is solid and the king of youtube  end of story 
love how he talks about self control  while i am sitting here eating ice cream when i said i would not 
it is okay  forgive yourself and focus on the next day   a day in which you should severely punish yourself and make it clear that you are in control of your body  starvation  lashings  or asking your family to get out the embarrassing baby pics of yourself and have them highlighted all evening  go with whatever punishment you find suitable  s 
                                         
tthe fact i have lived long enough to see pewds do a book review  i am at peace 
thanks pewds
the moral of the first book is  desire is the root because of all suffering   
try metaphysics i dare you by the way it has nothing to do with physics
you will own nothing and you will be happy  fuck we are doomed
its ok your still fun  d
this is why he passes you pewdiepie this is why
pewdiepie help me someone scam me
wow
you deserved it
do we now do a pewds versus mr beast like t series and if so will mr beast get involved to reduce his own subs so pewds wins  
now that you achieve ethereal form  will you make a new book 
being first  1  or the first are two different things 
who still thinks pewdiepie is no 1   
listing for me and yours sake  in the buddhas s words  an anthology of discourses from the pali canon the nichomachean ethics   aristotle enchiridion   epictetus the gay science   friedrich nietzsche the mathematical universe   max tegmark this book loves you   pewdiepie
i cannot wait for felix and pewdiepie colab 
why hasn t felix read the most published and read book of all time  the bible 
pewdiepie has become the antithesis to mr  beast
the way i screamed when he said book review
you can skip over a lot of this and just read the bible  the same themes are in the bible but people don t want to look into it because of their preconceived idea about it
you look like messi these days  
found felix when he was sitting at 30 33mil  that was so long ago 
being a buddhist  the essence of buddhism is that  evereything is impermanent  if you are attached to impermenant things  you suffer therefore let go of everything 
long live the king 
hi
bitch  lasagne bitch  lasagne mr beast are not nothin but a  bitch  lasagne
wtf did i jyst watch
watching this made me remember my brother talking about the essence of existence at breakfast time lol bless him
love his book reviews because he inserts humor that i can actually relate to  cannot wait for the next one felix
i know it is an unpopular opinion  but mr beast videos are overrated 
5 39 because of his accent i swear he sounded like he said  epic titties  instead of  epictetus 
i really have to work on my self control too    it creates a toxic relationship with myself  when you talk about your workout improvement it really motivates me and gives me confidence  would you make a before and after working out video  for me seeing big improvements gives a calming feeling that there is hope and i can do it if i put my mind to it   starting is the hardest for me   
you ll always be  1 to me
umm felix the sun is a giant ball of plasma not gas smh my head 
book review  
love the book reviews  hope to see more of them
me with an audiobook app   i am one step ahead of everybody 
i do not know in what category pewdiepie comes under he does everything
gg you lose even you are views is terrible ba le po po paw
well  i knew it  the lion king  and who else
you fell off
you should also try quran
wewe dielive
pewdiepie having 111 111 111 subs okay  
mr passing pewds is so useless to be honest
mrbeast
bullshitmaan
i thought the last book was written by felix kjellberg 
reason why it has so many repetition line or word is  during buddha s time there were no writing stuff to write  and no light in night  so that is why buddha give discourse in pali canon with many repetition word to easy read by heart 
you know if he tried he could go to the top but i like this phaze the book review phaze
hey pewds would you try to read some fiction perhaps some fantasy would like some fun reviews out of it  i recommend first law trilogy 
i am excited pewdiepie finally bcomes a monk e 
haahaaa
i wonder what sive was thinking while editing this
read the holy quran next  
is promoting and causing a craving of addictive poison the right way   g fuel   pdp is a drug pusher 
i want happy wheels part 200 
really need those japanese series  
more 
will it be considered suffering if i want more book showcase   
i like buddhas  
it s been seventeen hours 
you know what this means  time to start playing amnesia again  stephano and everything 
he is mature now
read faster poopoo brain we need more videos like this one
this video gave me a feeling that pews could be easily a teacher in high school or uni 
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
if you have not read on nietzsche s will to power in his genealogy and or zarathustra  as a mediocre uni elective philosophy scholar  i recommend 
finally another book review  
 
felix is woke 
what are you insinuating
there s a philospher called epic tits 
my wife will not let me get a gaming pc to start making content till i get 1000 subs  help a brother out people   
lol try read the bible  actually very pog book with good snack
finally book review is back the next is meme review and lwiay come on felix you can take over t series if you do that
i love the fact he spelt subs wrong
do not worry pewds  yo still my number 1
pewdiepie you need to make good videos like mr beast
rest in pride legend
but whatever you say  felix is the best single person youtube channel  there is no denying that fact   i come from the kingdom of blue shirt kid 
great video felix  i have declared
thank you for introducing me to stoicism pewds  it helpes me cope with my everyday life with anxiety and more  i really apreciate it very very very much  bless you 
just letting you know that your audio is a bit low for some reason and it was hard to hear you but l love your book review 
 you could have just checked bro  had me in stitches
s  ubs  lol
anybody can surpass the beatles right now   but the beatles will always be the beatles 
quote pewdiepie on every single word out of his mouth
come on  wheelies 
imagine using your platform of 10m  actual viewers to teach them self love  philosophy  and psychology  i wonder how many people actually stayed for this one  either way this is what influencers should be doing
i remember the  subscribe to pewdiepie  era of mr  beast and it s surreal how much has changed over the last few years
mrbeast          pewdiepiegames                   
more book reviews
i want to buy a game so what should i do   should i order the game online or drive to the fuckin game stop 
finalyyyy i have been looking for books to add to my list 
no cap  i would love some more happy wheels gameplay  who is with me 
eren jaeger should have studied stoicism
i love you man  this a good thing that you are a big youtubeur and a good guy
ah yes  kelly clarkson  the greatest philosopher to have ever walked this earth 
mrbeast at 118m subs now he probably will not delete his channel since he did not read those books  
mrbeast has comitted treason against pewds
 
 markroberprize  what
so i can take his arms right if not legs
what an iconic video  
you should read the quran  not as a religious holy book  just read like any other book  just making a suggestion  a book suggestion 
but you cheated with your subs  
pewds have you considered reading the quran i remember a few years ago you said you wanted to read it what happened 
i am not interested in book reviews but sometime si just like to tune in because i like pewds geniune spirit in making them
merry christmas  felix 
yiss   been waiting for this  thanks fam
give a dollar away to like 100 people and you ll go back up  
mr beast still said that pewdiepie will forever be his senpai lol
yeeeeees book reveieieieiwiwwww
i see parralel universes not as science but as a romantic dream of what could have been  more of science fiction not as science fact 
pseudo intellectual 
we all know the real reason mr beast is passing pewdiepie in subs is just so he can take on t series to get revenge for all of us 
 t series 231m   youtube movies 159m cocomelon 149m  set india 148m    mrbeast 118m yt music 117m pewdiepie 111m
mr  cringe are not got nothing on our man pewds  brofist all my life

you got to 100m sitting at a desk  single handedly entertaining  mr beast burns the candle at both ends running a gigantic operation buying subs with giveaways  not impressed by that

the book reviews and the 90 day reaction videos are my favourites  i was so sure don quixote would be in the next review because a few videos ago i thought i made out the penguin clothbound editions of don quixote and the count of monte cristo on the shelf
unfortnetly i dunt reed buks
best series on the channel
 you could have just checked bro  you had a wife  fucking killed me
do happy wheels part 200
pewds seems mind blown by the wonders of the universe  so here is something that really blew up my brain the first time i heard about it   the universe is believed by most to be flat 
hello pudidi   yes actually i can not speak english that is all goodbye
6 29 it seems they also thought their frontal lobes are not useful 
pews make a review of books with negative emotions  
hey poods  just wanted to say a thank you for introducing me to snus last year  now i am addicted for several months now  life could not be better   
mr beast disstrack coming in
maybe pewdiepie is not sad about that but  now our kids will not know pewdiepie as the most popular youtube channel  not counting t series 
ahhh lint roll your shirt
shame ending
it was never about the subs  it was about the friends we made along the way
 pewdiepie i still remembered vividly a book introduced called  master and margarita   it is so far one enjoyable but very bizarre book i read   although i missed the old day pew playing silly game  it is still great to get a new perspective from book from background much different from me   love you 
may be mr beast have more subs but i do not feel him like brother but yoou  i can listen you all day just relaxing time
  thank you  just in time
this is a very common misinterpretation   dukkha  is translated as suffering  but that is not an accurate translation  it is more accurate called the  unsatisfactory nature of reality 
buddhism is the most realistic philosophy in the world  
pewds try to give the quran a read  i think you will like it it will teach alot of thing s 
more book reviews
never matter to me who is number one in subs pewdiepie is always number one for me because he still have good and enjoyable videos  anyway mr beast is also good about making videos   gaming attract subs   i am not saying mr beast is good or pewdiepie   now when i think about it  compare between them is hard    but i was not thought about mr beast will pass pewdiepie in subs i get a little bit sad for it  
read the quran
never

this video was boring but it is still good to change it up here and there
read the quran
pewdiepie deserves to have more subs then mr beast to be honest
i think this is the firts comment i have ever made on a pewdiepie video  i have been looking for philosophy books to read and also buddhism  thank you for this 
read quran pewdiepie
read the quran
ever heard of da bible  it answers that very question  what do we do here
have not watched pewdiepie s videos for quite some time now  that is when i came across this video  i genuinely liked this kind of video that is wholesome and useful for me  its like watching a useful self improvement video but with pewds cherry on top  appreciate it 
would you ever start a philosophy podcast in the future  
i thought he was joking about book review 
helo felix  if you like stoicism  then you should check suffism 
if you made more gameplays and challenges like mrbeast you could have got more subs than t series
i have a feeling that most of the people subscribed to mr  beast want a chance to get money and not because they actually enjoy the content
i do not think  unlike bigass corporations  pewds has any problem with mr beast surpassing him but i am looking forward to the rap diss video anyway
should i subscribe  i do not really watch his videos but like does he want to surpass mrbeast 
mrbeast   we cannot surpass our master  his fans   we never heard what this man said 
gay science  how to ignore science  lol
hey man i suggest reading the quran  i think it will give you a new perspective on life and maybe change yours 
i don t think he s into science fiction
 eryk4030 very respectful and truth seeking from you  also very original 
cannot believe he blessed us with another book review  what is next  zombie poppy gloria coming back from the dead   is she coming back to give biting critique of the wacky goings on in the current state of the world  a man can dream   are we going to get a run down of all the spiciest memes over the past few months  dear god what year are we in  could it  could it be  another horror game playthrough  will we see the return of beastmaster 64  which timeline is this 
i fear losing my loved ones  it scares me too much 
to me subs are just numbers in the end the real number 1 youtuber does not have the most subs he or she has the best community  content and mentality
every body sub now 
that is why i admire pewdiepie so much 
pewdiepe  you said you read comments right  well i hope you do read this one    if you think that alcohol was a suffering for you  then you should probably delete the videos where you spoke about the alcohols you likes  do not even watch it just delete it  you might save someone from getting tempted 
has felix covered kant would love to see him give his interpretations of kant s formulations 
please do more book reviews
the content of this video was a pleasant surprise judging by the title
no not the s ubs   
i do not know about you but i am  still waiting for happy wheels
i have a problem with stoicism  sure  you will be happier as a person  but you will not achieve anything 
pewdiepie  mr beast pass me by subscribers let me talk about books  got dame i love this 
pewds please play games again without live streaming  i really miss your old content   love you felix 
guys i want to start reading books  what book should i start with
p  going to act like i care
book   review  
have you thought abut buying  the quran 
can someone list all the books his naming  i couldn t keep track  
wewe dielive
now that is a pain in the asss hope jeffery and bill do not catch up 
pewds read geeta one of the best philosophical marvel of the world that happened in reality    
felix showing who is smart kid to mr beast
imagine that a few years ago mrbeast was telling everyone to sub to pewdiepie  and now he passsed him 
i think this video more than anything  has shown me how little i read  
we need happy wheels 
damn mr beast  but pewdiepie  but will always be the king of yt 
the difference is mrbeast reached 100 mil with a team   you did all by yourself  you are the king of youtube  
                
you have got 1 thing mrbeast does not have  me as a subscriber 
makanya minimal itu punya agama bro  
someone will make the equivalent of a video about pewdiepie in a 1 000 years 
love how subtly funny and entertaining the review for each book is  ok  maybe not so subtle
i don t care who surpasses who anymore  pewds is a historical arch in the youtube realm who dominated the subscriber count for years  i ve seen him play horror games back when it was 2012 lol   on that note  do a calisto protocal playthrough pewds  would love to see it    
how did aristotle know that twitter and instagram was bad
this was great   an knowledgeable
gg  it s been a good run also  thanks for the book review felix
ya know if i had a history teacher like you in school   i probably would not have fallen asleep i am 46 an you are one of my favorite youtubers my teen kids got me interested in you an ken i get so many laughs because you have an i do not care attitude with some comedy hope you are channel gets waaaaay bigger
we need happy wheeeels backkk
pewdiepie appealing to his ageing audience i see  16 year old army 
wewe dielive  it sounds like a star wars character 
hey guys can you make it 1 million likes 
will you make a video about ufo 
i love these videos so much  more book review
because you been living in japan having to seen anyone drifting 
its just like the simulations
pewds is a lone wolf from hotdog stands to accidentally owning 2 cars in japan mr beast needs people and audience  sponsors  teams  youtubers  cameramen  and tons of fake money to attract more viewers ending wanting to get neuralink brain chip in his brain after 100 people take it first  pewds has a friendly fun and comic heartfelt neighbor that wants to play games with you voice mr beast has a friendly voice and video editing that it gets you to watch until the end pewds is a youtuber mr beast is a youtuber pewds when he makes another video  he does not need people mr beast when he makes another video  he needs people to remake squid game 100 vs 100 up to owning an island and chocolate factory pewds is not that busy mr beast is a busy person pewds has peace  mr beast has peace  i think 
waiting for the nkjv bible book review   
waiting for mrbeast comment to appear
i think you  ken an dane should do a couple videos together as a trio
personally  i got freaking bored of mr beast  his and his crews behaved is very repetitive  i am also tired of these youtubers that are way over the top  anyway  anyone else feel that way 
no every one love mrbeast
i really appreciate your recommendations  i love this video  thank you 
lowkey  even though it is not as fun as the old days  happy wheels would have been interesting
this is my favorite video of yours  i am on the exact same self control and personal developement path  i have never read buddism but i do think life is about midigating your suffering until you are comfortable enough to help others do the same for themselves 
so wise 
pls happy wheels 200 
budism is fake
besides  mrbeast is just a guy from fortnite ps  a joke
there is a great series on the summarized buddha called buddhawajana that you can sort by topic 
mr beast was a fan boy now he bacame a part of the capitalism system he will not delete his channel just a bussiness man  he cannot keep his words   that is what capitalism is and they think they are the coolest so congrats  
hamza ahmed
please read quran translation next  it is amazing 
will mrbeast destroy t series though
me beast kind of sold his soul to do it though  a while back he became less of a single youtuber and more of a corporation with multiple product lines and million dollar sets  pewds got to 100 million sitting in his bedroom doing reddit videos  so i am going to at least  he s still the most famous single person on youtube 
felix needs a kid 
pewds i am watching you for years were getting older man bit you still the king i am 29 not 10 hahaha
thank you
you re a legend man
bro they cannot take your legs because you have none 6 45
among us baka weehee
that buddhism quote sounded a lot like an old white man from savannah ga   i say  i do declahre 
never mattered not like even 2mil will watch your vid
111m  but mine 
you will always be the king og youtube     
pewds smells like cheese
noooo do not ask mr beast to delete his channel
mrbeast is being subsidize though  so he s technically cheating  long live pewdiepie 
mr  beast have trek video language in his channel   lol   maybe soon 2x with your sub bro    
this was a good video  thanks for the insights 
bruh  plz read ishmael by daniel quinn or anything by daniel quinn pleasethankyou
bruh  idc how much you love pewdiepie  there is no way people find this entertaining  he is literally reviewing books
this buddy is passing the nectar knowledge of the gods  fucking love felix
 you carved your own path  you followed your wrath  but maybe we re both the same  
so i guess i am smarter than everyone
7 1k
i wonder if mr  beast will actually delete and uninstall 
no he will not
that just feels weird since most of us first heard of him because he bought that sub to pewdiepie billboard when tseries was comming for the crown  is he still thinking of buying billboards for him 
this ll definitely beat beast to the punch
pewdiepie is successively ascending into the greatest philosopher walking on this earth  i think he may be the incarnation of god  we are thankful for this wisdom felix  long live pewds 
your words are honestly therapy  pls do more
this cannot happen
no
book recommendation for pewds   sapiens  and  homo deus  by yuval noah harari 
pewdiepie will always be the king of youtube 
dude if you are not letting the stubble  at least leave the mustache on  you look so waman now
i actually bought a book titled  stoicism and the art of happiness  from one of his reviews i have been reading it ever since and i am planning to have another book related to it  thanks pewds 
when do we see aaa colab 
smosh once gave you the crown  and now you pass it on to mrbeast 
do not worry bout it big dawg  his channels going to die soon
does subscriber s matters to pewds i mean he was ruling youtube for years and the work he used to put in those days was more than mr beasts we all know that
i love it when you talk philosophy
this is what happens when you start slacking dewy boi
we got copium overdose here
amaze he still doing vids  
 i have declared 
la alih ala allah   
allah is fake lmao  just a fairytale 
love the philosophy and book reviews  title was very misleading  
you will always be our number 1 pewds  no matter how many subs you got   
based on how many views this guy has i don t think his number one  
 xxghostwrld bro forgot pewdiepie retired  
 nomercytosimps729 cory left yt and still pull more     shut up my guy
 xxghostwrld did not ask
 xxghostwrld stay mad and shut up
felix the art of war says if you can beat them join them and take over from within 
i was definitely not expecting this  but it all actually makes so much sense  in a humorous way  
i clicked on this video and did not expect bible study well needed though lol i am intrigued
pewdiepie is still number 1 in my books lmao mr beast is like an entire company  pewds is just pewds and his editor  i do not know feels more intimate in my books  is that cope  maybe but hey pewds is still the biggest  gaming  channel lmfao
pewdz  though you may not see this  look into karl jung  one of nietzsche s students 
i still consider him to be the  top  subbed youtube channel  pewds spent way too long at the top to be anything else
pewdiepie  self improvement  ahoahoahoaho   
if you want to abstain from cravings and want the longest lasting relevance  look into the english translation of of the qu ran
quran is literally the most disgusting hateful   misogynistic   homophobic fairytale out their 
hah
its ok to be hurt  all those books and you still don t get it 
respect to mr  beast and all the great things he does  but pewds will always be the king 
you asked for it
i remember when mr beast had like 25 million
felix need to read the quran 
nah a shitty fake book with shitty philosophies 
it was so funny hearing your first experience reading nietzsche lol i always felt that reading nietzsche was so difficult and i felt the dumbest person  but that was also what i enjoyed the most too  thank you for the book review pewds 
do the little red book next time
1 54 what a chad  popular rich youtuber and he uses android instead of flexing an iphone
when you realise their are android phones much more expensive than the iphone hell flagship samsung phones are literally the price of an iphone  
this guy is enlightened after reaching 100m  man is the buddha of youtube
you can exercise all your life and i can not we will die roughly the same time on average it is kfc for dinner tonight
felix is still number one to me because he did it the smarter way where as mrbeast did it the harder way buy spending millions of dollars per vid
you have had us behind you since the t series war  we love ya brother you ll always be  1  never had to buy anyone s follow
 good or bad doesn t exist   i d like to see you say that when someone robs you
still  1
want to know why you ain t winning  cuz you got boring g   all you do is reaction videos and talk shi vids   play scary games again and say  tooooo spaceeeeeee 
book review yehey  
do goat simuator 3 and get 200mil subs
congradulations  and all the best 
time and space are not infinite  both will end some day 
even if mr  beast did surpassed you in subs  you will always be  1 for me   remember that brofist     
pewds  love you man  but there is one objective reality  there is one objective meaning  and it is found in the personhood of jesus christ and the gospel of jesus christ  we are all dead in sin and trespasses unable to stand before god as righteous for we have all sinned  but god who is rich in mercy  because of the great love that he had for us made the one who knew no sin  jesus christ  to become sin and die on the cross as a sacrifice for our sin  therefore  we are saved and made born again by the grace through faith in jesus christ alone  the death  burial and resurrection of jesus christ is the historically evidential truth of all time  the holy bible is the most historically accurate piece of literature of all time  and there is more validity to the new testament and the authenticity of its authorship than any religious text in history  but it comes down to a simple point  we are sinful god is not  yet though undeserving of this grace  god passed grace upon us by sending the son of god jesus christ  being fully god and fully man  to bring salvation to those who believe  according to gods sovereign will  god bless you   galatians 2 20
pewdiepie you are meh nowadays
 mrbeast your move 
chris tucker  ancient teaching of booty 
booo mr beast joking but still
mr beast is awesome no doubt but pewds will always be the best
bro so traumatized by mr beast that he forgot he reviewed  ethics  once before already
the reason is that your channel turned into vlog and reaction channel  you were a gamer youtuber  i really miss seeing you play minecraft and horror games
i love pewdiepie like actually  i do not watch his vids on the regular but he was my childhood  mr  beast might have passed him and he deserved it  but when i think of the king of youtube  it is going to be pewdiepie for the rest of my life     
huh  never read any of these books  but i feel i tend to try and follow a lot of what he is saying  i have never been afraid of death  just weary of the aftermath  is there heaven  will we come back again  does our spirit  energy  leave our bodies and continue wandering earth  or is it the one i find to be unfathomable  nothing  i hate that one  i do not like the idea of us going through life  learning everything that we do  experiencing everything that we do  just to end up as worm food  nothing else  although  life is an adventure of its own  so death is simply just the next step into that journey  guess we will find out when our clocks stop ticking 
we want timmy back
mr beast diss track maybe 
great book reviews   saves me from having to read them 
he has to delete his youtube account now  goodbye mr beast
   
 
like my comment       
yo i remember that deleting channel stuff lol
well it was fun while it lasted beast  so long
don t fortet what felix achieved  for nearly all of his 111 million subs  he has single handedly entertained us  that s a huge achievment 
it s a lifestyle  
silly happy philosphy  that is what the word needs 
such an intelectual
then  mr beast supports pewdiepie now  pewdiepie supports mr beast philanthropist swedish gamer
you should give him your tiara
meme review
in parallel universe you are watching my book review video pewdiepie 
repent and trust in christ and you shall know the truth  
it is because he takes the money he earns and actually gives back 
damn good book review 
always love these videos thank you pewdiepie 
you should of done happywheels part 200
i mean  i originally subbed to watch you play horror games  that is a super rare thing now  
disstrack nowww 
i enjoy this content and absolutely needed to hear this amazing  keep it     
he has crons it s fine
i do not know why but to me my beast still seams like a fake or someone who wants to ask me to join the group
  
pewdiepie if someone is your brother what would it take for you to fire them 
6 00  whenever i drive in japan   shows korea 
real
i remember being scared to comment as a kid growing up it is nice to see how nice everyone is now
then self controlling is suffering too
mr beast on his way to beat elon musk next by buying tiktok   reddit deleting both doing humanitya favor making us go outside more 
 
love you pewds always   
 whoever reading this  do not give up  hustle everyday      i am not a bot  i just love to spread positive message 
i am so sorry  i will unsubscribe from your channel and then re subscribe  there  you have 1 more sub 
crazy good message 
try gita for once
camera quality review next 
we miss you played horror game pews   
too bad he still does not have any legs to take
the video we all have been waiting for 
pewdiepie goat no cap  edit  bots exist  you never know how many people were involved in low key espionage for self interest  look at t series for example  it s like there s just no way  pewdiepie is in the hearts of us all  and respectfully to all content creators alike the same as well  i d be really bored without youtube creators out there 
pewds you should try actually reading the bible 
pewds  if reading manga peaks some interest  try reading vagabond by takehiko inoue  alongside the amazing storytelling and art  the manga displays much value and wisdom  plentiful life values   also  i am glad that at the zenith of this platform  the one who has achieved the most  is not the most despicable man  but  an opposite to majority of the personalities which makes the face of youtube  a man with substance  who values life and its virtues 
this is the content i want to see from you 
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
book  review  
i literally don t remember when pewdiepies subcount changed
when are you goin to read qur an bro
i love how he said   i do not care about subs anymore 
pews  head and shoulders my man
mr beast is a phony
i would love to meet you someday but aside of that you know pewds i am something of a scientist myself and omw to buy them booky  books      look into quantum realm  and maintenance the approach of science and magic correlating and being all one at the end of the day
maintain 
taking perspective into consideration i see
father  are you not the most powerful being in the universe anymore 
                                  
i pray to myself  i see myself above everyone 
wewe dielive
love you pewd
       
you should read quran the book of almighty
lmao the fairtail book that terrorists follow is fake af   we do not need more hatefull books to setback humanity to mediaeval times 
 cj bb3yv brother if you  read it you will get the answer
 takila4964 i am an exmuslim mate  the quran is filled with nothing but hate and fear mongering  people who like to believe to fairytale cannot stop themselves and have no self control over anything
bible time 
i became addicted to my hair  long pretty hair  i had nightmares about losing it  so i cut it  really short  i became happier and when it grew back i was happy and i had good hair again simple non permanent things 
presidepie it s ok  just team up with mrbeast to beat t series  pewdiepie will always be the goat no matter what
some just list all felix s recommendations till date please
enlightened pewds
book review gang here to say thank you for another book review
you need to read the quran

y all get a life n have kids get a career not worried about youtubers  did anyone of y all play outside or sit inside all day after school on electronics  a bunch of nerdy geeks  he is not mr beast  i m not wasting 12 mins of life listening to this    
s ubs
these are my absolute favorite videos  i ve seen your videos since the amnesia  era  but this are my personal fav
how tf did he go from playing horror games to talking about philosophers
the clickbait title leads to the greatest life lessons known to mankind 
way better than mrbeast for me 
tru
so buddhism is just if you give a mouse a cookie 
cannot wait for the pewdiepie colab felix  even if you are just a discount mr  beast  i will always enjoy reading the great words of pewdus 
overrated
you should read halo  mortal dictata  really good read  highly recommend
this guy just grows and grows and were joining him  he will not fall off 
we need happy wheels 200
mr beast is the new king of youtube but i d say pewdiepie will always be the father   big brother of youtube
if you think about it and remember  mr  beast did not really blow up until he started promoting pewdiepie against tseries really tuff  he definitely got a ton of clout from using pewdiepie s name  not hating just keeping it real  
thanks felix 
bruh  why did i like this video so much
ahkkk i cannot speak english or there are not any english youtubers who use indonesian
this is such a bruh moment
i fucking live book review
he has been upgraded to the big bro and could become uncle and dad in the next upgrade
merry chrismast payment
pewdie ie please read al quran
play games pewdiepie
felix  where is maya   
thank you for doing these  your book reviews and deep dives into the greeks have left a deep and lasting impact on my life the last few years  it is made me feel like i have woken up after decades of being in a coma  no exaggeration  thank you 
la alih ala allah   
la alih ala allah
aww i was waiting for mr beast diss track 
bro def going to tell mrbeast to get some b tch lasagne
suka banget sama pewdiepie seorang creator yang sangat kreatif sekali dengan konten2 yang pastinya sangat keren dan memotivasi kaum muda buat selalu berkreasi 
i would love a pewdiepie podcast where he just talks about this kind of stuff and other thing he has learned etc  that would be awesome
still he is
mr  beast dix 
read dante felix  it s very interesting because it tells a story infused with all these different religious and philosophical ideas but through the guise of one man s thoughts and struggles
i should say that the divine comedy is where most people start
pewds  do not take my legs what legs 
another book id recommend is   children of time  which completely changed the way i thought about aliens and any encounters we may have with them
he never wanted to pass the king as he said in an older video passing the king is treason jimmy looks up to pewdiepie maybe a collab next 
i really enjoyed book review  i m definitely going to look into reading these books now 
i love you pewdiepie your always be big daddy
umm he paid for those subs          
 live life good  do not live forever bad     pewds
holy shit i really enjoyed this video you have become your full potential pewds  
kings of youtube smosh  the odd one  fred  the abomination  nigahiga  the beloved one  ray william johnson  the aloof  logan paul  the unruly  filthyfrank  the revolutionary  pewdiepie  the fallen one  mrbeast  the chosen one  felix  the ascended one 
you guys are both goats   
i was not expecting a discussion of such deep meaning  pewds never ceased to amaze 
bruv should have listed the books in description
i had a bad day  the last few days been very tough  i have been very depressed but watching this video made me feel a little bit better 
you should do distract but compliments instead lol
holy shit it finally happened
i am glad to see the book review series has finally returned
contact fortnite  lol if it matter you re still the best 
i recomand you to read quran and science by help of a scolar
can mr beast be the hero we need to beat t serious 
pewdiepie is a true intellectual and creative genius 
mr beast is an independent conglomerate with jimmy as the face at this point   it is still mostly just felix and sive doing it all  and for that you are still the number 1 most subscribed creator   keep on crushin  it man 
 brad 11 never forget 
 rosalia2940 dang  calling pewds a god now huh
no mrbeast is the best not piediewpie   
 edgaraguayo2267don t worry you ll grow out of it
he got less though
 swagmaster16 yea but pewds isn t a corporation  many companies have passser pewds even years ago youtube s gaming channel had 79mil subs in like 2015 lol
 rbmedia8798 you do not understand sarcasm  huh 
 dishwasher69 through text  wow  i really should ve picked up on that sarcasm though the screen there 
 rbmedia8798 i was about to make the same comment  like they really thought they did something  or that was their scapegoat xd
ahhh  the copium
 edgaraguayo2267 you will grow up  rat boy
bitter
he is not even third what are you talking about 
love you   pie 
hey pewdiepie    i truly enjoyed your recommendation  mans search for meaning  thank you x1000 for book review    xoxo
i need more book reviews pewds
copium 100    
ah yes  buddishism
i love you
epic tiddies is my new favorite philosopher
mister bees
i doubt pewidiepie cares  he has cut back on his uploads and content in the past few years 
enthusiasm hopefully more subscribe
dumyss
anyone willing to dethrone pewdiepie is unworthy of the title 
yes i would like to knoiw less but more focused so more in thast way
bravo
and life goes you back
we love educational pewds
the fact that felix made it to  1 and held it for so long solely off of funny videos and games compared to mr  beast giving away a bunch of money and things just shows to me that felix is and will always be  1
pewds is a youtube goat
if you like nietzsche and that style of writing you may like carl jung  jung obviously more bent towards psychology but also symbolism and a lot of spirituality and connection etc  the first time i read young it was one of those experiences where you feel like you do not understand what the hell he is talking about and then the very last word hits you like a ton of bricks  it is obviously translated which may be contributes to that  highly recommend it though 
cmon  bring up dostojevkij  d
youtube keeps recommending me videos from mr beast or videos with mr beast or even videos remotely involved with mr beast and i never hear a peep about pewds  pewds is obviously shadow banned per leftist socialist protocol  elon needs to buy youtube and restore the dislike button and the recommendation algorithm 
pewds still have the highest sub counts to any solo youtubers thooo
i genuinely think felix should turn his channel into a philosophy channel and discuss more like this  i really enjoyed watching this 
mr beast has a lot of fans that are young kids and pewds has fans that got old with him and now we read books together
well  call me a traditionalist  because i am not changing
i do remember when he used to be a very small youtuber
pewds was the first number 1
good stuff man  i am impressed 
took long enough
ahh yes the origin of suffering  i need that book
do diss
death is a consequence  and therefore  bad  if life can be extended beyond improving quality of medicine and intelligence  death could be a consequence of lack of planning in a sence or lack of proper authority over one s life 
what is this video  i mean hey it was good but he started about how he got passed by nrbeast then started talking bout religion and gps stoicism lmao
damn bro fell     off
drunk
if you have not already you should go make a short video with mr  beast handing off the crown like smosh did for you  you expressed how much that meant to you so doing the same to mr  beast would likely mean a lot to him  
really loved this type of video     keep it up pewds  
you fell off lmao
laugh all you want he living his life in peace
you fell off because you post boring video like this
please talk about topics like this more 
9 year old army has moved to mr breast
i am more rich than you
i unsubscribed from mr beast for you pewdie  
felix  i thought you were going to review blood meridian by cormac maccarthy  did i miss it 
women are less likely to have wisdom teeth  so i m assuming his wife probably didn t have them for him to come to this conclusion 
pewdiepie really got me thinking about life  make the right choices in life  thank you pewds
omg mr beast why did you do that 
yes  bhikku bodhi  pali canon  omg pewds is going full thai sri lankan theravada buddhism lol  i have been trying to comment about those exact books  if you want more in depth stuff  watch dhamma talks about the majhima nikaya  or read bhikku bodhi s translation  australian monks also have some wonderful english dhamma talks on yt  namo buddhya  also  vipassana saved my life  zazen too  got to do it daily  more thang longer sessions  15 min a day is better than 1 hour 3x a week 
it begins 
copium lol
 forget who made you 
sad to see mr beast go out like this
wow  
end of an era 
the pain in his eyes  
ggwp bros
no yukio mishima  shame
aww so you two aren t going to have an epic diss track battle  
damn it pewd s  time is a human concept that is not real  it is just how  we  measure things relative to our lives  yes life is suffering  it motivates you to do  things  aw shit my stomach hurts maybe killing something and eating it will help  100  agree social media is garbage unless you have a message to send about how garbage it is to open eyes  love you pewd s 10 10 would hug sorry i am a little drunk
 budizz   aridotl 
pewdiepie walked so mrbeast could run
brofist
felix is the one who started youtube  a very long time ago and never failed to make us laugh for his humors  memes and content  he may have lost the battle  but will win the war  jimmy is richer but nowhere near as funnier as felix is in his level 
do a minecraft harcore with jacksepticeye please
those minecraft series he did with jack were three years ago huh time flies real quick
pewds still number 1
everyone  listen  everyone just make another youtube acount aand subscribe to pewdiepie  maybe you have already done this  i do not care  do it again 
 to oversimplify that don t go on twitter or instagram 
felix will always be number 1
still  the first real gamer to reach 100million subs
hey  felix  can you please do timestamps with the books names on your video  pls  i sometimes watch the same portion of your video more than one time  to understand it better 
by the way this are things that was told more than 4500 years ago by hinduism bhagav ad gita lord shri krishna
me instantly going to unsubscribe to mr beast lol
i would lol if this video was sponsored by audible 
i will always love you pewds
the quran you missed the greatest book on this life and other 
damn he really beat you in s ubs
as someone who started watching pewdiepie when i was 12  pewdiepie has been like that much older brother who is a bad influence sometimes but overall has your best interests at heart  he was the lax older brother that let me watch him play games i was probably way too young to be seeing  but then he also shifted into the person who showed me what it looks like to screw up and take responsibility  when influencers were starting to become a big thing with people my age  promoting consumerism and hypersexuality and growing up too fast  felix was getting married to the love of his life and learning how to play minecraft  providing a great example of an actual healthy relationship and teaching me that it is okay to stay young at heart  sure  maybe the humor is a bit low brow sometimes  but that is why i am so receptive to it  meanwhile  like vegetables snuck into dessert  younger fans are exposed to an influence that promotes self improvement  exercise  healthy diet  reading  minimalism  financial responsibility  philosophical exploration  philanthropy  and nordvpn  
true 
you summed it all up very nicely 
sounds like a poor life choice
i am about to watch the whole minecraft series now
who knew that pewds would become one of the greatest philosophers of our age 
thank you for your book review about a manga called blame  it is my fav story world  i love it so much 
tf is on his lip lol
i want moreeeeeeee 
why cannot we just have two kings and technological world peace      
omg please do happy wheels xd
review snoop dogs cook book
i was thinking about your other book review  but i will take your word for it lol
at 11 are you joking though lmao
it s because pewdiepie used to be the king of youtube 10 years ago  he s kind of retired now
and pewdiepie did the same in his room legend  
subscribe to pewdiepie god damnit
true satisfaction comes from having the mental ability to hold yourself back from the things you  can t stop  stay strong kings we ll get there  thanks felix this actually opened my eyes a lot 
la alih ala allah   
 user hw9dz5qo7j ahamdulilah brudda
long live pewds 
at 10 30 it feels good to hear you apologize
do more book review 
mrbeast disstrack when 
why you live in japane      japane is garinnngggggggg
much better t seriesssssss
when you proclaim a sub war when the channel you are competing against is 8m subs ahead of you 
pewdiepie you re not a real gamer until we get a sims 4 series  
he has a point
i do not know even though mr beast surpassed pewds in subs  i still feel like he is number 1  he is still relevant up to this day 
he became philosopher   a wise man
yo luis  kiana  angie  yahvdeil  sophia  rylan  alex  you all suck i hope you guys have bad lives because you certainly ruined mine  angela your constant nagging on what you want to do at work was so bitchy and annoying i actually thought this can t possibly get worse  but i was wrong  you have a cold heart of stone and i hope you go fuck yourself you two faced  short mother fucking godzilla devilish bitch 
at 6 20 it literally feels like he is reading my mind i could just be crazy though
the popular anime  stein s gate  does a great job summing all felix s book choices here in one series  alternate dimensions notably  a  anime
subscriber no subscriber  still the best youtuber 
this is my favorite pewds vid
i love your bookshelf  sir
wow looks like the king has been dethroned by his partner in the war between t series and pewdiepie
buddism is so based  guy got sick of providing for wife and kid so decided to sit under a tree and ignore them 
we miss the t series and cocomelon battle vs your subs pewds but we must move on and accept the fact that pewds is retired for subs and felix is enjoying the life in japan right now  time flies
me waiting for the disstrack on mr beast
pewdiepie is a single guy youtube channel and he got over 100 mill mrbeast is a rich man with a crew
i love buddism book  try also bushido   
let us go
if you get up to get to get down  do you stand on a egg or wall hanger  shalmomalongadingdong nome wadda samin
i studied about happiness and eudaimonia in my psy 111 course about positive psychology  awesome vid  felix 
asceticism
book reviews are amazing  i have got back to reading due to this  and have thoroughly enjoyed some books discussed here
haha epictetus
nicomachean ethics is one of the most interesting ethics book you could read  i recommend pewds so read  sophie s world  or something related to chinese philosophy  like lao tzu  confucius  etc  it is so interesting to read because it will change your perspective about everything  it is like from being fpv  first person view  you will turn into tpv  third person view  like it will teach you more about realism of life  graduating philosophy course is one of the stepping stones for me to be better  also try some epistemological books  you will like it  if you are interested to more  try metaphysics 
enjoyed this    
mrbeast passed you because he did a worldwide survey of the number of viewers who watch the most in the world  among them is brazil  he offers fun videos dubbed in portuguese  you do not even bother adding subtitles in portuguese  i do not just say brazil  several other countries can also be listed  so his work has been surpassed
to be fair  mrbeast has a whole team that can do those things for him  pewds is one guy  and if you watched the video  it does not matter to pewds  it is not a competition   
mtbeastvstsedies
pewds really is the long awaited philosopher king 
i do not know why but i always return to being mostly happy by the next day
thanks felix for introducing me to the nicomachean ethics  i remember you covered that one a few years ago  in a way  i felt like it said alot of things that you already know about life  but it really did have an impact on my life and i have gifted it to people who might need it  that is all on you  cheers
wow he now has more subscribers
virtue is not defined by stoicism underneath a boot  kill those that oppress you 
lol
mr beasy deserves it to be honest  his videos are very unique and fun 
never heard of him  he is creepy looking 
pewds   you gave up long ago    if you invested the money and time beast does ud be at 200m
it is just pretty sad that mrbeast said to always subscribe to pewdiepie  look at him now 
no book clicked off so fast
stoicism  you die when you die  do not worry about it  just make the most of what you have right now 
to be fair  you have done all this without giving us a dime  that is pretty alpha 
book review is one of my favourite pewdiepie series  because of it i read sidhartha which was amazing so thank you felix 
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
what a pleasant surprise 
you are still a legend pewds
is this sponsored 
pewdiepie or felix whichever you like more do you cry so people forgive you or because you actually feel the need to cry 
back when you started you made me feel good to cry because you did all the time then you posted that video and i wanted to believe but you made it hard to
pewds  i d love to see your review of either  mere christianity  or  the screwtape letters  by c  s  lewis 
to love is to know and understand  you could really dislike someone but  if you could understand why they do things that they do  or act a certain way in different situations  then you would love that person by really knowing them  i did not explain that well but it is a real thing  because we all act and react differently in different circumstances or see experiences differently  we are all doing our best with the information we have  it is up to us to expand that knowledge and in turn  love one another  nope  still not explaining it well but i am not a philosopher 
just play roblox
read the gospels and acts in the bible my dude  the witnesses to these events died for the truth of them  the upside down cross for example is peter s cross  a direct witness to jesus who was killed for refusing to recant 
just unsubbed to mr beast on gang  ogpie till i die
you should try reading the quran  you will find it interesting 
felix i think you would really enjoy the what we owe the future  it has philosophy  human happiness  the grandness of the universe  etc  etc  seems up your alley
crazy how mr  beast started his channel from a pewdiepie shoutout and now he s surpassed him in subs  been fans of both since i was little and it s been wild watching them both grow 
what is there to like about mr  beast 
 sewerfruit5638 i don t really watch his videos anymore although his older videos were much different than his current stuff  his older videos were more of a commentary style like piediepie does with stuff like his  worst intros  series where he would review the worst gaming youtube intros he could find online 
 sewerfruit5638 he makes over the top content designed to go viral  not my kind of taste to be honest 
 sewerfruit5638 mr beast is as overrated as a channel can get  he has absolutely no talent  his success is similar to cover baby tunes and russian kids toy review getting most views on youtube 
 bonzi4446 how  little  are you right now that you grew up with mr beast 
 pullimau8555 i m 20 now been subbed since 2012 so i was 10 when i started watching him
 true love   the love of god  god himself went to the cross for you out of love for you as a human being philippians 2 5 8
 bonzi4446 i do not think he was relevant in 2012
 pullimau8555 obviously not i m unsure what you are point is though
 bonzi4446 7 years ago struggling to hit 100k views  yea he sure was relevant back than compared to now
 pullimau8555 never said he was relevant you asked how old i was when i started watching him  stop arguing with urself and get a life 
 bonzi4446 2017 
 bonzi4446 i said that he was not relevant in 2012  obviously not  well he was  and you disagree  and i stated some facts
 kenny jame different acc cuz the other one is my full name like urs which isn t the best thing to have public i am going to
 pullimau8555 i literally agreed with you lol you are so mad over nothing dude  i said that mr  beast was obviously not relevant in 2012 he was new to youtube and it takes time to gain relevancy 
 kenny jame i m not trying to prove anything just thought it was interesting that pewdiepie essentially created mr beast  not sure why everyone is mad at me for watching mr beast in the past 
 pullimau8555  mr beast wasn t relevant 10years ago so that means you didn t watch him  
 bonzi4446 i miss old mr  beast  he would  just do random stuff with his friends  like one video was him and his friends microwaving everything they could find
 jlaubster yes  i remember that video those were the good old days  at first his charity videos were a nice change of pace especially when they were like  giving a homeless person  10k  or stuff like that  now everything seems so clickbaity and scripted i m not a fan 
this thread is a perfect example of youtube commenters that are just itching for something to argue about lmao  you all attacking this dude over literally nothing
 bonzi4446 dude i forget that 2012 was so long ago lmaooo
 bonzi4446 jesus h  christmas i am going to go crawl over into the old person corner and die now 
la alih ala allah
 heisenberg368 his old videos did not reach 100k views  and i bet back then it did not reach 10k views
 pullimau8555 who cares let people watch what they want stop acting like you are above everyone cuz you watch pewdiepie
this reminds me of what technoblade was like 
pewdiepie is still no 1 individual creator
time to break out the lasagne   
pssstttt hey pewds  mrbeast is 118m subs now
i wish this video came out 8 years ago so i id have a higher grade on my philosophy class
this is a piece of art lol i fell wise  thanks felix 
surprised mrbeast has not commented on this
legendary
i love nicomachean ethics and theologeia by thomas aquinas  would recommend  changed my life having to study it this past semester in ethics 
lmao also meditations as well  
bro just realized
what
mr beast is i give money who wants money  and there are so many people who are entertained by that which proves that there are more stupid people in the world than normal decent people
i knew it this day will come 
sry to inform you but the 2022 physics nobel theory discredits the idea of parallel universes  its a pain in the aass to understand but the bottom line is  the universe is not locally real 
11 57 lmao
t series and mr beast can surpass you  but i will always be your 9 year old fan 
you should read the quran it will change your world view
at least mrbeast was a proper channel to overtake you
i always loved book reviews  we need more of them 
i just wish i could be like pewdiepie be successful and good content 
wewe dielive
11 57     no   
thank you pewds we have been waiting for the book review
bring back happy wheels
lmao w
this is definitely better than lwiay
this part  felix kjellberg  will always remain in this life of mine  you have taught me like a guru  thankyou for everything  
i do not know how to feel because you all are both good
10 years ago pewds yelling barrel  and me going yes  today pewds talking seriously about epictetus and stoicism and me going yes 
hey pewds a 19 yr old here   can you please do a two sentence horror reddit review please i have been subscribed to you for a long time please  
the best book is the holy bible it has all the answers in life and not these self help books
hi bro felix  it is interesting that you read about philosophy  i just want to recommend that you can read a few islamic philosophy books like the book  muqoddimah  from ibn khaldun  keep it up bro  thanks  pewdiepie
klk
 l 
interesting ideas
i do not know of anything that you re talking about  mr beast is relevant 
budapie
5 48 can control and can control
epic tetus
what a banging video  wish you made more book reviews 
book review yes
l bozo
nan
i needed this video  the vibes are immaculate
poodiepie
it is ok felix  i am not subbed to mrbeast but subbed to you   just not into the  clout basedness  of his videos 
more book reviews  pewds 
honestly at this point pew  you are  youtube royalty  you have cemented yourself as the first solo creator to hit 100m subs and you have been on this platform longer than most  i hope i can speak for your fans and others when i say that you are a living youtube legend no matter who eventually passes you in subs     keep up the hard work brotha   
subs don t mean anything his views is actually horrible for someone with that many subscribers cory gets more views then his videos and doesn t have as many subscribers ksi gets more views and doesn t have as much subscribers pew is not really special besides his subscribers that s why mrbeast is passing him he pulls in more numbers when it comes to videos
 xxghostwrld you know million viewers are already many and comparing youtubers are useless thing ever since they just lives better than us
 xxghostwrld subs and views do not mean much  multiple generations will know who you are talking about when you say the name  pewdiepie  even if he quit now  that is still legendary status 
 mirrors8913 same goes for the people i named off
 mirrors8913 not really  things move way faster in this day and age  fred was the first to hit 1 million subs  my nephew who was born in 2011 and watched youtube and coryxkenshin does not know who tf fred is  pewdiepie will fade and that s no shade to him but in a couple of years the kids may actually ask who tf is pewdiepie  but they will know mrbeast
booooook club
love how this guy tricks his 14yo incel army to consume actual quality content
we are are all part of the incel army my brother that is why you are here  energy cannot be destroyed or created

an end of an era
hey pewdiepie  i have a very interesting book for you to review  it is called the quran  please read it with attentiveness it will change your whole meaning of life instantly

nan
i am so glad i have gotten to watch you grow over the years  i still love your content and watching you 
i will read our mathematical universe  let you know what i think on the next video 
2 21 every religious people 
 
the coolest part of this is using something that s a meme to talk about serious things and give an informed summary of them and why they matter
no matter the amount of subs you or any others have  you will forever be the  1 youtuber  and forever remembered for your videos and being the first person to 100mil subs and you nostalgic intro  i have been subbed to you ever since you made your first slender man video   even thinking about all the great video s you made happy wheels  slender man was a huge one  g mod  and all the other games horror or not  when ever you made a video no matter on what it was amazing and original  thank you for everything  and do not forget who is the greatest youtuber of all time 
review the bible next
don t worry pewdie  beast gives avay all his moneyh 
start minecraft again
big brain pewdie 
you will always be the king of youtube  you were for the most part really a one man army  unlike mr beast who needs a huge team to help
i have not watched pewdiepie in years but i can definitely tell that his accent has changed a lot during that time
all that work just for some automatic rich guy to come take over in less than a few years  no hate though  jimmy s cool   zoomers suck though 
why is it that i love your book reviews 
happy wheels part 200 when 
pewdiepie is bill russell of the boston celtics  he was the greatest in his era  but mrbeast is michael jordan  the greatest of all time
wholesome diss track 
i love this
i heartily recommend g k  chesterton   the everlasting man 
rip
now the old bro has become a father
pewds pls make more lwiay videos i miss them
as i get older i will realize one day i m going to have to tell my kids  well my favorite youtuber back in my day 
pewds topic theme today is all about freedom  in other words  he want to be the pirate king
you still be our number 1 pewdiepie  
bro you need a person who knows lot about buddhism to teach you that the hard thing about religion is that you can be easily misunderstood by reading it  you need someone to teach it 
how do you feel
wonder if hes read the new testament 
play elden ring colosseum now
pew it is ok beast did not mean it
wanted to reply my comments by mr beast
i am going to pewdiepie is still the biggest solo youtuber mr beast has thousands of employees multiple companies and channels that post his videos in every language he is just a nicer tseries
lmao the very end  
how about fiction books  you can get a lot from them like maupassant or jane austen or modern authors maybe
2 09   
mr beast passing pewds in subs and then him putting out a book review on famous philosophers completely sums up the character growth he has gone through in the last few years
also clickbaited thumbnail so that viewers can actually experience the philosophy even if it is not nice but does great help to viewers
jesus christ is the propitiation for the whole world s sins  they that believeth and are baptized  with the holy spirit  shall be saved  but they that believeth not shall be damned  those led by the holy spirit do not abide in wickedness      god is one manifesting himself as three  the father  the son  and the holy spirit  bless him   for these three are one  as i am led by the holy spirit  nothing i state is a lie  but the truth of god  anyone who tells you differently is misinformed or a liar  they do not know god  nor led by him  anyone who  claims  to be a christian and is against what i am doing  and where i am doing it  the holy spirit does not dwell within them  they lack understanding  they know not god  read his word  and their religion is in vain  do not hear them  they will mislead you  the lost cannot guide the lost 
another truth many have been deceived of  when you trust in god and cast your cares  worries  anxiety  depression  suicidal thoughts  upon him  they will be no more   know that there is power in the name jesus christ  his name casts out demons and heals  the world is wicked  evil  and of the devil  i too  was a wicked sinner of the world before i opened my heart to god  i am living proof of god s work and fruitfulness  he is an active god who hears the prayers of his  god s children are set apart  holy  and righteous  the devil is a liar that comes to steal  to kill  and to destroy  that includes your relationship with god  open your heart to god  repent of your sins  he will forgive you  and let him direct your path  draw nigh to god  and he will draw nigh to you  cleanse your hands and purify your heart  lest you walk with the devil and follow him to hell 
 call upon yah do you have like a job  or a hobby that is actually a healthy habit my brother in christ 
the titanium balls on this man  i love that he did a book review instead of talking about subscribers  this is why he is the vibe 
la alih ala allah
 isaacandfelix it is a spam account  there is no job or hobbies involved 
 princess anon that probably applies to the creator of the bots
well pewdie is quite boring ngl
 call upon yah yes
 princess anon is either really bad or really good in his way
 call upon yah satan offered me a cupcake and in return i would join his religion  sorryyyy i just loooveee cupcakes
 simplymartinas opposed to you and your content huh  is this some low key way to self promote  you say stuff like this for attention 
i mean  it is not like he would have beef against mr beast even ironically lol  he was one of his biggest supporters during the whole sub war against t series and cocomelon
 romanvonungernsternbergnrmfvus i do not have content to promote why trying to be smart 
everyone sub to felix we can still win
i like the bible  
i love felix s book reviews
felix you should try reading the al quran  it will definitely change how you view things
he is killing you in subs  not just surpassed but annihilated 
wtf is this comment section its used to be good 
so virtue  pewdiepie should donate 99  of all his earnings to hungry kids in need  no organization no  go out in the world and spread the food directly to hungry kids  
meow meow boy in 2nd place nooo curse you beasty boy
never thought i d watch a pewdiepie video with him talking about spirituality
it is happened a lot  actually  it is my favorite segment of his lol
pewds has yet to uncover the treasure trove of christian philosophy
this was educational  thank you pewds 
without pewdiepie  there s no true youtube community 
pewdiepie  has abs  smart and still retain a swedish accent 
pewdiepie still the goat
hey felix i encourage you to read the bible  not saying you should commit to the religion  even though it is more of a relationship  but i think you would be intrigued by the values that it has 
i can see why  
love these videos 
yo  cannot wait for pewds to talk about buddhism with garnt 
this was genu
  
i love book review   
he s lying  so many times i have gotten a sudden craving for reeses puffs and never touched them again for 45 years 
plz more book reviews
honestly  these are the contents i love the most from pewds  he s inspired me to read and work out  it s been 6 months and i ve never felt so much happier and healthier 
always my numbuh 1 pewds
gangangangangang
dude this is freaking great  having deep opinion from a great youtuber you like is awesome 
well pewdiepie got this many subs without buying 2000 people a lambo unlike someone else  he still number 1
mr beast is incredible  you   just another annoying voice on youtube
cannot wait pewds diss track for beast
this is when the student overthrows the teacher 
i started reading kieerkegard because of this guy
now compare the budgets by both channels getting to 111 mil subs lol
he listened       
mr beast is trash content
fyi aristotle did not check to see if his wife had fewer teeth because he had not invented counting yet 
tich naht han the present moment must read   and the bible broooooos
epictetus getting some love       
he s been moved from house to house
you should read the quran for next book review
read quran 
i actually had read some felix recommendations
well he is on 116m now legends  
pewdiepie will always be superior to mrbeast in my opinion
4 10 wealth  fame  power  gold roger  the king of the pirates  attained everything this world has to offer 
don t worry pewds  mr  beast sucks  i know you re not even trying  you re in happily ever after mode  but he could never be more entertaining  and fulfilling   or gorgeous
we just going to let the king get passed 
wow bro
was hoping to hear your thoughts on blood meridian
love for pakistan             
mr beast in an old video said unsub if he passes pewdiepie
damn kind of boring lol 
how the tables have turned   john 3 16
i think stoicism is summed up  it is what it is

wisdom review   
well  we all knew it would happen eventually  just did not expect it to happen so soon 
whhhaaaaaaaaaaaaatt
women  on average do have less teeth than men  on average we both have close to 32  but women s average is lower than mens  sooo he was right on that  check it out  it is true 
it is not very significant  but it is important to remember that women and men are different 
he has defined the king of all land and conquered it we shall not ever watch mr beast ever again or you will be sent to the pewdiepie hell 
its funny how mrbeast always used to say subscribe to pewdiepie  now he has more subs than him lol
play fortnite to git a head of mrbeast
pewds will always be  1 in our hearts
hey felix  ever considered reading the bible  it would be nice if you did some kind of book review on it 
do not give up  your more entertaining 
next episode  mrbeast vs  pewds  airing 2023 
pewdiepie is the goat and that is all that there is to it 
pewdiepie  the emperor philosopher of youtube  kind of like marcus aurelius
this video came at a real opportune moment for me thanks pewdiepie
thank you felix your book reviews have actually led me to reading books that actually got me out thru dark time love you man
la alih ala allah
mr  beast basically bought all his followers though
i actually just noticed that this legend pewdiepie actually posted his first yt video two when i turned 2 years old  what a honor
you better delete you channel mrbeast  
god i love your voice           also  not wanting things is a sign of depression         believe me  not wanting anything fuckin  sucks     figure out what makes you happy   do that               
guys  remember when mrbeast said if he passed pewdiepie in subs  he will delete his channel  bye bye beast   
book review based
ill take pewdiepie s voice over mr beast face anyday  something about it makes me angry  sure hes a nice guy  but we could not be friends
i had to sub  i just love book reviews 
i love mr beast but pewds did not have to buy his subs
you know you are better  you do not have to explain  buddhism its about suffering its about ending the suffering  life itself about suffering  by the way i am a buddhist 
subs don t matter just matters that people enjoy
as of 2022 good
went from being the funniest guy a know and truly an enjoyment watching him play games but now he is doing book reviews  sad

another district songs
whers the old pewdiepie that plays video games
talkin about nietzsche at 111 mil subs illumanati confirmed 
you ll always be the king of youtube no matter what felix  even if you re retired lol 
typo in title
pewdiepie da goat  
mantappp
bro one of my friends is like crazy about nietzsche  it makes more sense for life to be about overcoming  that nihilistic viewpoint 
if you and mr beast combined subs  you d still have less than tseries
have your read the popular religion books or reviewed them  they are the top tier stuff in book writing i am going to
keep going   
pewds  i have watched you for a decade  we have had a lot of laughs  kudos on all your success  you have worked hard   but dad    i do not caaaaaarrrreee 
ngl i miss pewds minecraft series when december enters 
where s gloria berger 
i do not know about this one
never watched felix s book reviews  but it s as good as meme review  and never forget  felix is one man   and wife and stupid dogs but they are in the basement don t worry  and for one man to have 10  of a billion subs is insane  truly an epic gamer book dude 
there are those who live  in a buddhist country and see  the truth  about buddhism  there are those who want to live in  a buddhist country because they think they will find  truth  there are those who read about buddhism and think they understand  truth 
lol finally 
 i have declared 
11 46 sorry to say this felix  but i am pretty sure he is the guy that keeps having sex with your wife 
read epictetus enchiridion as my first book in a long time  loved it taught me a lot and deffo recommend  ty pewds
pewd de pie i see you hehe  0 blem  p
still better than  what was the other  scammy  guy that literally came outta nowhere 
1st book seems like a good reading book for like 1st graiders because the repetition
pewds  you are not jacksepticeye  he makes the worst decisions when playing adventure games  i love yelling at him when i play his videos 
mr beast used money and click bait to get his subs  pewdiepie used his personality and humour  and just being himself to get his subs  he s still  1 to majority of people including me 
1 54 he took a picture of me sitting on the toilet 
i always knew pewdiepie was creepy but not that creepy
i did watch it and you have handled this well  i too read a lot books and can appreciate these reviews 
bruh the clickswitch
 i am happy that pewdiepie support mrbeast the kid who support him since beginning 
just make a collab video with a famous spaniard and you will gain 20 million subs in a few hours 
a book review of bagavath geetha  it is known to be the equation of life
nah
would prefer if pewds owned twitter 
still a fan since amnesia thank you for making our childhood awesome  much respect bro
nah hold up i thoight you had more than under a million
i am very very curious about your thoughts on biblical teachings 
ouch  do not take the lord s name in vain 
mr  beast in fortnite
i wonder what your thought on a manga that has been said to took inspiration from buddhism  houseki no kuni  i think it is a great read and it opened my eyes to some degree eventhough i hold another religion 
mr beast grew by offering people money challenges  pewdiepie grew by connecting with his audience on a personal level  felix will always be the goat here 
mrbeast used to look up to pewdiepie too
bruhh 111 million sub are still freakin big
love to see you getting into these types of books 
i will just make 8 mil more accounts
watched just to see why this guy is popular  no freaking idea  no desire to see anything else he has done  no idea who beast is either  pretty sure i do not care  is this video not totally boring  i do not get it 
really want a meme review bing chilling
everyone who watches this video should subscribe like i did 
love your s 22  
mr  beast is just p ss boring and makes people idolize wanting to win money more and makes a incredibly greedy and superficial society  hit i wish i could win a million bucks to help my mom pay off her debts and mortgage and give back to her for everything she game me aka a life  but no everyone else want money
i was  waiting for bitch lasagne  mr beast version 
 i wonder what mr  beast is doing 
you said  good and bad does not exist  however  you cannot have virtue without morals  you talk of virtue  but you deny right and wrong  you are mistaken my good sir 
nerd
book   review  
pewdiepie   guts  mr beast   griffith
when the disstrack droppin
i miss book review
delete   your channel as promised lol
s ubs
unrelated to this video but wonder how many people really want felix to finish his subnautica series  maybe do below zero too  or has subnautica died yet    
l
fellow nineteen year old here  bring the book review back  it is so interesting how we grew up with pewds together  from the amneisa days to book review  it amazes me that we developed into being better people at the end of the day  much love to you pewds 
i think felix kjellburg might have murdered pewdiepie 
if you crave a guide or answer to life   n you get one  but now ull want more answers  more guides  better ones to make you happier   it never ends
wtf man
s ubs
i m definitely down for happy wheels part 200
sad but someone had to beat you pewdiepie and i think mr beast does more fun videos and challenges to be honest   you should of taken part in the sidemen charity match with speed   mr beast  
this is the perfect antithesis to mr beast videos
just do something with friends like mark and jack
pewds explaining how being alive as a probability is how i think about reincarnation  you will not immidiatly reincarnate but the odds of the situation occurring that you are alive again one day is possible and in infinite time space you will be alive again
pews has become accended    
pewdiepie  start a book club man  i will be there
philosophy dilutes your logic of the world and your emotions which makes us what we are  try not to get deep with it 
mrbeast just makes better content 
ok 
marcus aurelius had literly everything  emperor   vs epictetus had nothing homeless slave  the father of stoicsm is zeno of citium who came from platos school influence  i firmly believe stoicsm and taoism philosophy is the best thing for finding joy within 
 don t take my legs    2022 pewdiepie  legs     2020 pewdiepie
epic tiddays
life is easy  define your needs to obtain those and everything else is a bonus  for me its food shelter water and electricity  as long as i can afford those things i will be fine  then if i am working to afford the bonus things  it is easy to let them go if i cannot afford them 
i am excited for book review but can you do another lwiay soon
if pewdiepie being overtaken by mrbeast and retiring will make him open up a book club is something i can hope to happen
my dyslexia made me read   mrbeast passed me in a bus 
mr beast disstrack when  i am joking  but would be fun 
yes  i love the book reviews i just read discourses of epictetus from your review of it  it s really gotten me into philosophy
ok pewds i am going to read those when i am at your age
pewdiepie is laughing outside but crying inside  joke 
the student has become the master
pewds is the kind of person you would want to be like 
i think it speaks volumes about what kind of guy pewdiepie is   seeing that his response to mr beast overtaking him in subs was a book review  shows his humbleness  class and maturity  it s so refreshing to have the biggest youtuber of all time stick to want he wants to do and not chase numbers   also enjoyed the book reviews so much
true
heheh volumes
definitely plus it is like he is talking to us about how he feels about it in a weird way but his way baby steps lmao
la alih ala allah   
you did not watch the last few seconds of this video did you 
meanwhile  he made a distrack on cocomelon and youtube took it down   
look at curry man so inspirational
 bumblebeegamerreal youtube needs a new ceo
agree  now subscribe to his channel
it is his way of saying he do not give a fck but also baiting people to watch the video  i love it 
 catrat that is what that guy already said  he is not trying to chase views he is just tryna do him 
pewdiepie is the best  i declared 
i d love to hear your review on joe dispenza books  they re really great and eye opening  also  i do not know if y all know but some scientists actually confirmed that chakras exist  these energetic centers in our body  and how to manage this energy in our body to become healthy and happy  there are tons of books about it and it would be exciting to hear about them from pewds  
don t worry pewds i will make another 60 million gmails to subscribe to your channel
w wdym another 
i am still going to look at this guy as  1  nothings going to change that  grew up with pewds
or bring back gameplays  please 
i think you would love reading books by the early catholic church fathers and catholic saints  it has changed my life 
i want a congratulations video for mr beast 
12 minutes of felix coping from being passed by mr  beast
i ve always tried to avoid you  but this is actually a really good video 
think about it  remember when mr beast wanted everybody to subscribe to pewdiepie  and guess what now 
he is 7 million ahead  
pleasure   steam 
now we need a happy wheels video  
i am buddhism and omg pewdiepie    i am not going to say nothing   
did you declare 
two greatest content creators of all time
sive felix missed a perfect opportunity for the office  i declare 
after all these years  you are still my fave one of all  love you felix 
la alih ala allah
exactly 
felix did not have to spend 10k for video to get to 111 million subs
epic
and at least felix isn t sucking up to elon
nietsche enjoyers wya 
i needed this
book review book review seriously though this is one video series i hope pewds never cancels 
i disliked you should have done happy wheels 200
man  i remember watching your book reviews from a few years ago  it got me more interested in stoicism and philosophy  i ve grown since then and decided to actually do something i ve always wanted to  making youtube videos  uploaded my first vid the other day and i plan on making more  thank you for inspiration throughout the years  and also goodluck to anyone else trying to do the same 
you are not serious  mrbeast is the new king of youtube 
is that book available on amazon 
even if mrbeast passes him in subscribers  we all know who the king of youtube is
 pewdiepie you still one of the best youtuber to exist 
been watching a long time and i have missed the book reviews  great vid pewds
please do happy wheels part 200
book review let us gooooo
let us goo
what about the book of mormon man 
you should read the bible 
i think pewdiepie could do bridge incident 2 and we wouldn t care
 s ubs   
you still got more views though
i think you d like paul s writings even if you don t believe in christianity
he said  you re born with noting and you die with nothing  so be content in all situations 
 
now a mr  beast diss track has to be in the works  then a pewdiepie vs mr  beast boxing match lol
who cares if mr beast has more sandwitchs than you bro
you should send him a personalized youtube play button for  passing the best  
is that a pimple on your lip 
what the fuck is this  i want more more book reviews please 
i find it absolutely fascinating that the works of people thousands of years ago are still somehow partially relevant to us after all of the time we have had for change and societal progression   technology resembling magic  previously unimaginable distance  and  admittedly barely  the better part of a hundred generations separates us from the greats of ancient greece and still we find that 70 generations is not enough to change the fact that people are still people regardless of time   we still strive for the same abstract goal of fulfillment and have the same struggles   we are no more intelligent and no less baffled by the universe and its incomprehensible scale  god damn i wish i could read  i bet they have some interesting things to say 
you chose this path pewds you left for japan  therefore you are voided
everyone sub to pewdipie or else hell quit
pewdiepie you should go back to your old style of videos  why conform to the new norms of youtube  just do it
could you perhaps explain all of this in layman s terms 
why is pewds not getting views 
day 4 of asking felix to play god of war ragnarok
its time to bring marzia back if you want to bite back at him
ahahaha same experience with nietzsche and beyond good and evil  very relatable 
next  t series diss track for mr beast overtaking them
do not stress or be angry about things you cannot influence  if you cannot get past that you need to find a way to be able to influence it  if you stay angry and will never be able to influence it you will be unhappy 
you re still so funny pewdiepie  the bit about your own book brought a smile to my face  bro fist lol
 
everyone needs to make another youtube account and subscribe to pewdiepie 
spelled subs wrong
do you think pew die pie reads these books in english or swedish 
pewdiepie is still the best youtuber for me  he is part of my childhood memories 
why do you degrade the double slit experiment  
interesting video  i had no idea pewds liked philosophy
man  i love book review 
i am sorry but if you can t reach 1 mil views in under 10 hours you are prob not going to beat him
the end of an era  but you will forever be the king of youtube  you made youtube  you are youtube  mr beast could never have the cultural impact you did   no hate to mr beast  it s just the truth 
bro you had like 130m subs what happened
as a greek person  as dumb as it may sound  i really like how you appreciate ancient greek philosophers  history  culture call it whatever you want  it is very rare to find someone these days interested in those kind of  stuff  maybe because it is connected to school  doing homework and having to study  but i truly think that people are missing out  i want to become an actress so i have deep dived into the whole  era  and there are numerous of times where i have been surprised at how could someone write things 2500 years ago and for them to still be relevant  i really do not want this to seem like i am bragging but i am truly proud of my ancestors because they contributed a lot for us to know the world as it is today  i cannot thank you enough for shining some light                                    p s  i do not think that my country or race is superior to anyone and i would never consider anyone inferior to me
i love greece
it is really sad people are not interested in that stuff  it is very fascinating and gives new perspectives 
don t mean to piss on your bonfire but there s a really good chance your ancestors weren t greek back in the times of ancient greece 
you are right it does sound dumb
 untouched light well it depends  it is possible that in the time of ancient greece   the classic and hellenic period we are talking about that her ancestors were not really greek  that later they settled in greece and mixed up  that is a big question as to what ethnos meant  for example people northern to achai and western to thrace  forgot the english name  were barely considered greek by achaians and were modtly barbarians since they lived of raiding  mercenary and piracy  by our modern meaning and later history they would be greek but at that time   questionable 
get a orthodox study bible
noioooooooooioioioioioioioioooo well played jimmy  felix  we still love you sooo much thank you for amking so many  smieelssss
call me a weird fan geek or whateva but felix is still  1 in my eyes cuz you ll notice the few channels that have more subs are like companies and corporations  felix never had like a large crew or anything making videos it s just him lol  i m not downplaying mr beast by the way he deserves everything but just sayin felix is like the most subbed person in terms of  one man army  
from a gamer to a grandpa bruh
i never even knew he cared about subs man s is just uploading video after video and has been doing that since the dawn of youtube  it s a hobby for him not a job
think about the fact that mrbeast has to do 10000x more shit and spend 1000000x more money just to compete with a guy who talks to a web cam in his office chair haha  if i could choose a youtubers life work  felix all the way haha  respect to the pewdiepie 
this is garbage  unsub
if i do not see another felix collab i am about to claim he is dead
bro books      
love you felix
gg
wait holy shit since when did mrbeast have so many subs i legit thought he had something like 50m not 118m
perfect time to add to my to read in 2023
enjoyed the reviews  
  wait did he really say he would delete his channel  fuck    
pewediepie is always going to be the best youtuber no matter what 
hey pewds  i graduated nursing school  thanks for all the content  i would love a meme review again or poppy gloria  or lwiay 
man  to have just one actual conversation with this man 
time for a collab with mr beast  pass the torch like gig 
this is click paid but love the video
so it s finally over with 
i have declared lol   that was the highlight of the video
you are always the best man
the sun is actually a giant ball of plasma not gas
poods the dooda
this cool  you finally do another book review  i will wait for another book review from you brother
he deserves it
whaaaatz  plot twist at the end of video  i do not see that coming   yes make it interesting as you said jimmy lol
man betrayed you
happy wheels part 200 would be sick
because he is just a better youtuber
mr beast loves to waste money but you don t
if every pewdiepie subscriber would create fake aacount  we could easily overcome mrbeast  
 i know what you are thinking you little smart ass 
these pewdiepie philosophy vids are so goated  literally the reason i ended up doing philosophy in college 
i used to want to watch your videos  and that caused me to watch them  but now with the new knowledge from buddhism i will stop listen to that desire  thanks   
i have missed these 
love this
the king is losing his place now  he remained at the top for too long  r i p youtubeprime
book review s back  yeaaaa  i read a lot  and it is super interesting to hear about books that really are not up my ally  but i find their concept intriguing  if that makes sense 
christianity also has quite interesting philosophy  similar to buddhism  self control is a fruit of the spirit  go explore the bible if you guys are interested  many principles are somewhat hidden but the internet will of course unpack everything for you if you find the right source 
he passed you like ovet a week ago 
maybe he will pass tseries too 
i want happy wheels
this is a cool video  i have declared 
how tf did mrbeast grow so fast
i ve never liked mr beast he exploits greed and hardship just never sat right 
absurdism is the way of life  bro   
it is not a book review  it is classic pewdiepie content applied to great books  i am here for it  side note on mrbeast  respect but it is really become a ridiculous gimmick i am going to  cannot watch his videos anymore  it is beyond a meme now 
i would really like to watch happy wheels 200
thank you kelly clarkson
i want happy wheels
more happy tires
what is verchue
pewds slowly turning into joe pera
not the chocolate pizza  
noooo
still waiting for felix to read and review quran    
anyway  split light test  is insane
more book reviews   pls
book review  0
these book reviews are gems
maybe aristotle s wife had more missing teeth than him 
you are the king of yt pewds  4 life
holy shit another book review
try to read quaran   i think you would like it  
videos for people to think about life  great 
bruh that shit on your lip has some shit on its lip
this is such an elite book review  thank you felix  for showcasing such eye and mind openers into our lives  ultimately  these goals are life changing and intrinsic knowledge is deepened to make life more fulfilling 
  so no diss track 
whenever pewdiepie lost to t series  mr beast did not take the defeat of the king lightly   mr beast overcame pewdiepie  in an attempt to rise to power  above all else   then finally  whenever mr beast  had become king  he would wipe out t series  in revenge for his king 
nice
wooooww
you still  1 my boyyy
cute
as a die hard philosophy bookworm i get what felix is trying to say with this video title  yes mr beast surpassed his subs but does felix cares  no because felix is reading stoicism and completely unbothered by that   felix has his own phase on what he can control and what he cannot control  he will stay on his comfort place because it is his domain and he has a different type of game that makes everyone compete against him while felix is not even competing with them 
but the craving for tambourines is infinite  
a youtuber finally passed pewdiepie 
company 
imagine preaching about stoicism despite being one of the most virtuous and lucky people on the entire planet 
mr beast diss track
absolutely love book reviews  thanks for this felix  
somehow i like speed s channel more every year even though i have never been able to predict how it changes  
b ch lasa a
diss track time 
dope as always
book review is awesome  series of good books pls
i can listen to pewds all day than my religion teacher
my wifi hotspot is still named  subscribe to pewdiepie  and even if it is a lost because  i will keep it because i am too lazy to change it
 wanting is suffering  well what if i want the book    
jajaja no pudo pared
pewdiepie is one of the most genuine and down to earth youtubers if jimmy passing him in subscribers is all it takes to bring back the book review sure why not
bro pewdiepie you have a samsung s22 ultra  your like me not wanting an iphone
excellent the truth mr beast if you upload good content to the change you will not
class act  <3
he should have done happy wheels part 200
dude you will always be my fav youtuber
he just got 7 mil more 
money talks  literally
is he making his cam bad on purpose now 
wait what
i strongly agree with the sentiment that life is suffering  i also believe that life is not worth living 
thanks for this video  i like the insights into what makes you tick  doing this with books shows a great deal of how you view philosophy and just life in general  i think it is pretty great sir 
la alih ala allah   
 user hw9dz5qo7j omg i thought th  same 
finally   i have been waiting a while now for another book review
i have read my fair share of books   i would say my top three are probably the bible  1984  and the art of war by sun tsu  i would say the bible surpasses all of the philosophical   religious books mentioned in the video 
the long raining king has finally been decrown  i remember subbing way when amnesia started  i even remember when smosh had game bangs   when markiplear did drunk minecraft  when skydoesminecraft was still going    good times some times you wish to go back
i admit i have not watched much mrbeast content although i know plenty about him  his style just is not for me  it seems much more geared towards a younger audience whereas i feel one can appreciate pewds at any age  i am kind of shocked he passed you in subscribers to be honest 
bigbang is a repeating process 
did he just promise us happy wheel part infinite  
sure hope one day felix kjellberg colabs with pewdiepie
you should flaunt your wealth more and be generally unlikable 
he plays happy wheels at 06 03
mr beast isn t funny or interesting  he just hosts challenges with people i ve never heard of  his voice and face are annoying  i wish mr beast would disappear 
    
felix eudaimomia is spoken as ef the mo ne a
mrbeast needs to comment on here
felix explaining gambling addictions with budhism be like
s ubs 
the funniest thing is that jimmey did not want to pass felix but his fanbase was bigger so it was his fans who did it
bring back lewy
pewdipie reminding me of my dad right now fr
wow  the worshiper has passed the king
y all think once up a time felix was so subscriber obsessed that he d be very disappointed if his future kids didn t subscribe    
omg yes
if i do not get happy wheels episode 200 now i will be very dissappointed
wooo
i love when you back
if you have reached buddha s philosophy  you should also look into other hindu philosophies as well  like vedanta philosophy or even older ones like vedic philosophies that formed the foundation for later philosophies 
stop bru
 yashrajgaikwad5629 no  i do not think i will
the new guy from fortnite has a channel 
it is the new low effort style  that is okay  it is a career  cannot complain much about doing good  just be thankful you are
i would love to see an official passing of the crown to mr beast
xyz
5 00 why does that apply to kanye so well  lol
i do not even watch mr beast or really even know who he is  i just know he does alot of stuff with money  but anyways you will always be the top youtuber to me pewds  the king of youtube  no matter who passes you
i just love how pewd s first reaction to mr  beast passing him in subs is to read some novels
i like the fact that he was your number 1 supporter in the sub war now he is past you
 sleep on epic titties  life changing advice  thank you
wow i was not expecting such an interesting video  good job dude 
the books are great books aswell
how fast do you read in pages minutes like these books look thick though and where do you find the time to read so much  o i am impressed
and habbits and selfconrol   how is you are drinking going can you make a recap video about how you changed and how long it held and stuff
still the best individual creator 
of course i clivk on the one video that says we all die while on the edge of an anxiety attack  not blaming anyone  it is just really fitting to my luck 
treason 
think of it in a good way  t series and cocomelon is going to lose
nice video pewds
lol
pewds always makes me feel warm and cosy inside  
i want the book loves you so bad
i want fridays with pewdiepie again  
i remember when mr  beast joked about how they looked up to pewdiepie and treated him like he was the god of youtube and now mr  beast even managed to surpass him in subscribers 
mr beast diss track
with t series  it was b  lasagna  just got to write some bars for the next sub war 
i just want you to know that you have been my childhood growing up  i used to watch your amnesia videos before i went to sleep back in 2012 2014 or something  i admire you for what you have become and hope you do more japan vlog type of videos because those types of your videos remind me of you and myself as i look back at the first time i have watched your videos  you are able to be honest and genuine after all this internet communication and that even makes me proud because of how much i enjoy and respect you as a person  i wish you all the best 
reminder that mrbeast supported a charity that wants to  cure  autism instead of helping autistic people
discipline   freedom
it s crazy to see how far mrbeast have accomplished so much  before the miracle of mrbeast helping the world and before he s famous around the world  long time ago mrbeast was just a small youtuber and pewdiepie was the king of youtube  mrbeast knows about pewdiepie and now mrbeast is mega mega big and pewdiepie recognizes him  now the king of youtube retired  mrbeast takes the lead of youtube but this time the entire world along side with him  so beautiful  it s like seeing the torch being passed on 
ernst junger is interesting
who is mr  beast  srsly i do not know  i am probably too old
when pewds first started youtube i was still very young but my brother always watched him  i kind of joined  when i started understanding english i started watching him myself  now here i am  fluent in english because of this guy 
i have read the buddhism and hated it because of how miserable the repetition made me  but aristotle and epictetus have helped me changed a lot  after that i read a lot more phylosophy books  they helped more than self help books  really thankful for you recommending these books  
5 37 the enchiridion
when read quran pewds  why is everyone converting to islam 
it s crazy how this guy got this many subs by sitting in a gaming chair
you could have just checked bro
okay but i am about to read all these
enchiridion is the greek word of guide  its trully an epic word 
talking head from youtube teaches children how to live  l o l
felix  i find it very cool that you read  there is a book that i would like you to read  it is called  the way of kings  it is book one of a series called the  stormlight archives  this series is amazing  it is an epic fantasy that is    easily on par if not maybe even better than  the lord of the rings  i personally love this series and it has gotten me through some hard times  i hope you look into the book   please have a good day  and thank you for your many years on this platform entertaining us   
mr beast been quiet ever since this video dropped
can you do a mrbeast disstrack just for fun
i did not expect this kind of video from pewds  i must say i was positevely suprised 
i find  suffering  to be a pretty poor translation of what the buddha meant  the original pali word is  dukha  and it is probably more accurately translated to  dissatisfaction  i think this definition allows for someone to really understand how dukha plays into craving  and overall has a much less fatalistic tone compared to  suffering 
nice
i hope pewdiepie can meet pewdiepie one day 
10 06 i declared had me rollin  
the fact that he still gained 11m subs after the war and being retired still mind boggles me
he is alreadz at 118 mil xd
thanks felix  i need to read some of these as well
pewdiepie should have done happy wheels part 200
battle of the botted subscribers   nah  jk i am kidding
it does not really matter but mr beast is at the point where the channel is more of a corporation than anything  if you count mr beast then why would not t series count
good series  based pewds good taste  edit i just watched the rest of the video and i have to remove one point for mathematic universe
wouldnta happened if you were the old pewdie   
this comment probably will not get seen but not to sh t on mr beast but pewds is still top solo youtuber  mrbeast is kind of a group of guys   just saying
mrbeast helped you reach 100 million ask for his help again this time to reach a billion
wow second place in most subscribed  you fell off
why no happy wheels  lmao
just be glad you are one of the most subscribed youtubers ever
easy for a millionaire  who flies private jet and can move countries just because of preference  to preach the virtues of stoicism
game for once felix aka pewdiepie 
ggs felix  the decade long reign is over  you ll always be the king in my eyes 
he may rest now
wth mr beast coup the king inside me is not a huge surprise
pewds content has evolved so much  lols from almost burning his whole apartment to doing reviews about books 
strange swedish man living in japan reads more strange old books and tells other strange peopel
10 50 pewds becoming rick sanchez
read the qur an  maybe you can reflect on it too 
thank you felix  very good  now that you are settled in japan  how about book review or rereview of japanese books and how you view them now that you are there long term 
was this a ad 
s ubs
for all the believers out there   all these topics are discussed in the bible 
you can still do happy wheels part 200 
love the book reviews  
you felix in minecraft
everybody get ready to sub to the new mr beast channel  i bet he going to do some big giveaway 
gg
mr  beast out here crushing lamborghinis while pewdiepie teaching us philosophy

felix single handedly entertained us all for the entirety of his youtube career   mrbeast and t series  we don talk about that    had to employ tons of workers and stuff  you re still the number 1 youtuber in the world dude  the rest are just companies now 
it is so weird seeing a pewdiepie video under one million views  in the future that might not be the case  but it feels sad to look at 
where is percy jackson and the olympians   l book taste l life
pewds  have you ever considered doing some kind of  reading with pewdiepie  kind of video s  where you read a few chapters of a book each time 
congrats mr beast on well deserved subs  i do not know who is this for  if you are  30 and reflecting on your life  just watch movies 
pewdiepie is a total chad  he honestly doesn t care  he does not care about subs  he does this because it makes him happy  we need more of pewdiepies
you should have done happy wheels pt 200 
bro he had 115m when pewds uploaded this and now hes at 118m wtf
 
man i grew up with this guy  just decided to check up on him  he hasn t changed  keep on doing your thing felix  thank you for getting me through my teenage years 
he has changed a lot  which is good 
epic tetus
it is because youtube and alphabet corp are petty and seemed to have shadowbanned  they plaster mr  beast and ssniper on the front page  they artificially made this happen  i cannot even see when you post a new video half the time  big tech freaks and their power 
n o o conhe o  mas  sim os v deos do mr beats e digo filosofia   legal  mas  filantropia   mais  fazer o bem e ajudar as pessoas e n o ligar para o dinheiro merece demais reconhecimento 
pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  a gamer  a news presenter  a gym bro  a philosopher  basically an older brother we have never met but became a significant part of our lives 
he made me laugh in the first 10 sec   i love pewds   lot  dit    can you read the quoran  it is very interesting
not surprising
no
i now feel slightly worse about indulging in the bar of toblerone staring me in the face across my desk

s ubs
here before mr  beast comments
you are the reason i smile atleast once a day      
ahahahahaha
yay book review 
this is the worse video i have ever watched from you
hahha well technically you are retired now  so do not mind it ma man       
did not you say the n word on that bridge 
 mrbeast where are you 
this is the greatest video ever
i read nicomachean ethics for a philosophy class and it s a very good intro into philosophy for someone who hasn t read anything in this type of language before  the class was called  ethics and the good life  and the entire class was about happiness  work  and leisure in the eyes of philosophy  it s a great book and truly has impacted my perception of life 
live life good  do not live forever bad  i nearly fell off my couch  
read the bible
still the king  
does mr beast really have 7 million more already 
mrbeast passed you pewbs
all we care about is you pewds  i have spoken  
i find it funny he clickbaited us to talk about buddhism
do not worry poods  we all still believe in you as the king of youtube
hell yeeeee du skulle ha gjort happy wheels del 200 felix
i will get book then come back
bhagavad gita is a great book too 
phase lifestyle
may i recommend julius evolas bow and the club essay book 
pewds got to over 100m subs by really just making random shit he wanted to make   from streaming games to reviewing random content   mr  beast started with a specific goal to win the game that is youtube   i do not know why but that seems like a different thing to me 
where is the dis music video  there was a giant spectacle when you climbed up to  1  i want to see more spectacle  lol
0 40 the pali canon actually contains 84 000 groups and i heard there are still untranslated ones
i was not lucky enough to know pewds for a long time but i am happy that i came across his channel he made laugh countless times  made me want to get in shape and think about my life decisions wanting to be better so thank you pewds for being there
la alih ala allah   
la alih ala allah   
do not worry  pewds will be forever known as the first true youtuber to hit 100m subs
booooooring
when war between russia and the you s  begins and the nukes start raining down i will be sure to watch pewdiepie in my last moments alive 
anyone who watches mr beast content is mentally loosely screwed  here ill make his next video   last to let go of the door handle gets this franchise owned store  xd like its just thoughtless popcorn  i feel like its more popular in foreign countries by people that do not have or see much  how do you think t series popped off 
i am that person that brings the double split experiment  quantum immortality  and realities in every conversation
i like how you turn this into comedy 
i have declared
mr beast is now at 118mill now
i think this is a prime example why mr beast passed you 0 05
lol
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ 
hi
 lamarlovesjesus amen
  lamarlovesjesus shut
thumbnail giving me midsommar ptsd
we need more philosophy felix
this is just felix having a mental breakdown in a video and making it seem like it s ok 
r i p mr breast  
so  sleep on epic titus  got it  thanks master for your wise words  xd
 i tip my hat to you  one legend to another 
thank you so much for doing videos like this  felix  the loneliness dissipates for 12 minutes because you talk and feel like a friend  also  thanks for further developing my interest in philosophy
 the student carrys the legacy of the master 
 
pewdiepie is a retired old man enjoying his remaining years  spending his time on things he loves the most away from the pressures of the yt algorithm  or maybe reaching the peak of yt makes him feel lonely  it is lonely at the top ya know 
keep seeking truth 
as someone having an existential life crisis  i realize how reading books really help you with changing your perspective in life and live better  i am really glad to have this type of vid again felix  finally more books to learn from 
just so you know  there are still people out there that are subbed to you and not mr beast <3
we are already at iphone 14  
well at this point felix is just enjoying his youth and i respect that cuz back on the day he was a legend he did all but now things have changed and now it is time for pewd s to live his life   
 marzia about to die  pediepie  stop crying you cry babay death is fine
 santysmart2982 wow i am so exited 4 my prize wat i win
can you please make a detailed book review  and your point of view  
review diary of an oxygen theif 
i love this new era of pewdiepie more than any of the past  
give the most inspirational sentence to felix and he will make it into a meme
react to sidemen  christmas songs
god i miss meme review
same problem  i read too much books and articles before and it feels like reading cheat codes  but i read less and most likely i want to observe and experience more now it just feels like time runs faster whenever i read and knowing too much made my friends and family cringe hahah  i guess i was a book addict
over all i like mrbeast better but pewdiepie is funny
would you describe yourself as a materialist felix 
hey pewds i just started drinking g fuel and instantly addicted i cannot believe you have been promoting it for a while and i never tried it  your  1 in my book i do miss your crazy stage at times 
can t wait for mr  beast to pass t series 
the problem with not being that person that brings up the double slit experiment is that you end up feeling like people truly do not know or understand how remarkable it is  at least after being a nerd about it you can feel like you changed someone is life a little bit 
bro really said pizza is better than burgers  
unlike others with over 100 million subs  pewds is just one guy who still uses bandicam  mad impressive
i was just thinking that  i am not putting mr beast down or anything  but he uses massive spectacle  spending literally millions of dollars on a video  pewds is just a guy chatting in his office 
 keithws2779 he is a retired chad basically
happy wheels part 200
i jus can appreciate when felix expresses his feelings or opinions
pewds i think you are ready for a short history of time by stephen hawking
can t be mad bro  look at the effort he puts in to his videos and the amount of people he puts in to his videos  you limit yourself to few people and just do react videos 
mrbeast are not nothing but a bitch lasagna
faxx
buddhism is self refuting because wanting to get rid of attachment to earthly desires is still an earthly desire  did not think you would fall for the eastern mysticism psy op pewds
how to lose followers
wtf
118 mil at the time of this comment  jesus mr beast really raking in subs haha  proud to both him and felix for doing so
even if felix doesn t embrace christianity  he should read the bible i think he would enjoy it
mrbeast passed me in subs 
no shit    
 ricodex8505 except the way your face looks 
 bradhambleton have you seen your doe     
mrbeast is at 118 million subs
people just sub to mr beast for a chance to meet him and get money
fax
they recently proven that space is not expanding and therefor not infinite
hes just saying not to be a npc
tambourine gang still a think 
my swedish buddhist grandmother has no idea what a mister beast is but she approves of pewdiepie  
no but fr i was raised by the woman and she recently moved into hospice  she s been turning mostly to her religion for comfort while she s dying and having a younger persons perspective on buddhism is very refreshing and reconnects me to it and to her <3 ty pelix
i think it is time for you to collaborate with ishowspeed
legend  
this is the biggest flex on mr beast because this is the kind of video that if it was posted on an account with 200 subs it would get 48 views  love it 
he bought at least 10 million of them
i feel like mr  beast fans are going to grandmas house and enjoying cookies and milk  while we re all here learning about the age old virtues of epictetus combing our newly grown sideburns   
you should read the quran sometime 
  
honestly bro it does not matter at all  you are both legends and i am happy to see you both on top  you are both monumental legends in youtube culture  
ngl this guy has to be the coolest sniper main i ve ever seen  
dear pewds  your camera is shitty sincerely  me
i do not really care bout mr beast having more subs  to me and many other bros  pewds will always be the king of youtube  ps  those books do sound interesting 
pewdiepie the last bos has pass 
yessss please make more videos like this 
why hasn t someone posted the titles of the books yet
finalllyyy
yea you should of done happy wheels 200
i acutally really enjoy how you simplify complex topics
could not be better timing for book review  that seasonal depression is hitting hard right now  so i am beyond ready for a good book to unfuzzy my brain   thank you pewds   
 to be that one person that brings up the double slit experiment in every conversation  fuck i felt called out xd
fake videos big profit
this video has a special vibe my man  10 10
this is an amazing idea  i got to find my own niche  i am floating in space with my content 
if you do release happy wheels 200  i would still watch it 
aye pewdiepie  you re still the  1 most subscribed in our hearts
bring happy wheels back  super fun watching you play
well the difference is that you came this far you are own  that is an big achievement 
pewdielive  
you put out recycled content where he puts out new interesting content  he was bound to pass you eventually  i am surprised your channels not dead allready hahah
what is on your face 
    2 38  me when i chew a sour lemon suddenly
pewds when is the next aesthetic marzia edited japan vlog pls
i still have my copy of this book loves you
can you do a book club where you tell us to read it and then you review it 
mister beast may have surpassed your subscribers count  but the amount of production cost he has to pay to gain maintain that amount of subscribers compared to your production cost per subscriber is very huge to say the least  with much less effort you reach out and entertain a lot of people 
not trying to hate on mrbeast  but pewdiepie s content does not feel manufactured or like he is trying to work the youtube algorithm 
yo remember when mrbeast said pewdiepie 100 000 times for you pewdiepie
nice  now i am about to go watch 2016 pewds videos
um  i would wayyyy rather have a happy wheels part 200 something  than you reviewing some goddamn books
you are still the mostiestest most phenomenal king of youtube no matter what  no argument ohryt  you are our very own legend   
watching this after my university philosophy final feels very fitting 
book book book i feel smarter already
psssssssst  to get on top  i suggest a space race  mr beast kind of has done it all  on earth  just be first to the moon  or even mars  sub to pewdiepie
maybe he did check and his wife had fewer teeth for some reason and he just assumed it was the same for all lol  
where happy wheels
r i p 
i am watching this while giving into my cravings ffs
i am a fan pewdiepie because i am swedish
mrbeast helps you many times pweds and it is not does not matter if he has many subs than you do not forget bro is always bros 
how is the bible not somethin here
i was not expecting a discussion of such deep meaning  pewds never ceased to amaze 
la alih ala allah
jesus christ is the propitiation for the whole world s sins  they that believeth and are baptized  with the holy spirit  shall be saved  but they that believeth not shall be damned  those led by the holy spirit do not abide in wickedness   god is one manifesting himself as three  the father  the son  and the holy spirit  bless him   for these three are one  as i am led by the holy spirit  nothing i state is a lie  but the truth of god  anyone who tells you differently is misinformed or a liar  they do not know god  nor led by him  anyone who  claims  to be a christian and is against what i am doing  and where i am doing it  the holy spirit does not dwell within them  they lack understanding  they know not god  read his word  and their religion is in vain  do not hear them  they will mislead you  the lost cannot guide the lost 
another truth many have been deceived of  when you trust in god and cast your cares  worries  anxiety  depression  suicidal thoughts  upon him  they will be no more   know that there is power in the name jesus christ  his name casts out demons and heals  the world is wicked  evil  and of the devil  i too  was a wicked sinner of the world before i opened my heart to god  i am living proof of god s work and fruitfulness  he is an active god who hears the prayers of his  god s children are set apart  holy  and righteous  the devil is a liar that comes to steal  to kill  and to destroy  that includes your relationship with god  open your heart to god  repent of your sins  he will forgive you  and let him direct your path  draw nigh to god  and he will draw nigh to you  cleanse your hands and purify your heart  lest you walk with the devil and follow him to hell 
good day to you  i reach out to you for some professional reasons i hope my text doesn t bother you 
dang at this point you should do coffin review you yourself have gotten old
i had a thought that one day  if man kind was just able to do whatever they would want  then what  where would we be and what we would do  i have noticed that to suffer or to be in a situation where you have goals that need to be worked on to get there is what makes the world go round and round  i guess you can say its from the world working purely on money but where everz 
i know that book loves you  but we love you too  stay awesome 
although  mr  beast has officially passed pewdiepie in subs  he still is number 1 to me  with him making it to where he was on his own for the most part
he made it there because of meme and partly because of mrbeast
pewdiepie was the pioneer
the og
 frenchie0800 he made it there because of my 1 sub real
the thing with pew and mr b  is that when he spoke to him  he had his support  he is lucky to have him  the other individual in question  for clarification  he 
pewdiepie still has more overall views than mrbeast
 dgfailurejust the main channel views is compared but perdiepie has more videos than me beast so if you basically add all of beasts channels then it blows pewdieoies view count off and ngl the amount of views pewds gets now vs what beast gets it ll be broken just by the main channel of beast s
 frenchie0800 mr beast is irrelevant during this era mrbeast was known because pewdiepie feature him creating billboards of him to help his fight againts t series
technically speaking  pewdiepie is still  1 solo creator  mr beast has an army of editors and translators  plus the two brand of mr beast burger and his chocolate bar company  plus a whole group of friends giving him constant ideas  he is a brand 
pewdiepie still has more views than mrbeast i think like 27b vs 19b  then again if you consider all of jimmy s channels he has even way more
yesss  
you are lame as heck    soon you will change your ming seeing him turning to dust
double slit is wild though  to be fair
mr beast is boring to be honest  but good on him for doing good out there entertainment and making a small difference in the world
book review
forsen
sn lla happy wheels part 200     och  we can do a review on your toyota  sn lla   
read quran brother  it is will guide you through your whole life
but there is no better than telepizza  it is the highest version of self control not to get to the closest telepizza and just eat
the world is saved  my grandpa told me about the legend of book review  and i am very honored i lived long enough to see it happen 
good book reviews  sorry about sub count 
felix you should try read quran
5 50  there are things in life that you can t control  and there are things in life that you can t control  don t worry about things you can t control  what a great and motivating quote pewdiepie really knows    
 
actually you can control things in life if you put in your 100  efforts and do hardwork 
 hardev jadeja1 even your families virtue and opinions you cannot control lmao
 kandi5319 just be manipulative and you can control anything
 qixe 6007 now start controlling the sun to hit the earth
i encourage you to learn the serenity prayer  i m not catholic  and i don t know any of their other prayers  but it s basically a distilled version of what felix said in your comment 
 qixe 6007 control my dad and make him come back
 l
my name
bro read the books
stoicism in a nutshell
 hardev jadeja1 you cannot control everything
why not use what you can control to control that which you cannot right now 
la alih ala allah
most of the time  you are not wasting time trying to control something you could not  you are mostly wasting time to learn if that thing is controllable or not
i heard it as   there are things in life that you can control  and there are things in life that you can control  
 cozyvrc the quote is misheard  because of his slight accent  what he said is   there are things you can control  and there are things you cannot control  do not worry about the things you cannot control  like the gps or the traffic like he mentioned even though he admitted it is a simple example  it is a clear one  he cannot change those things  he does not need to worry about them  same with bigger things  you cannot control other people  you can control yourself though  so worry about controlling yourself for example 
 danielramirezg2000 i know this  the comment puts them both as  can t  because i m guessing that s what it sounds like to them so i was just adding that the both kind of sounded like  can  in my case  but we can both understand what he actually said
 qixe 6007 you boy delusional
pewdiepie is so amazing guy and i really love your youtube channel and your videos
pewdiepie  have you read the quran 
so adorable
hey man  you should give the new testament a read  it is not a popular way of thinking  but i 100  believe jesus was a real man  born of a virgin kept the morale law and the ceremonial law his entire life  took the wraith of god that we deserve because we are sinners  and there is no getting around that  it is crazy  but we live in a world that tells us good is evil and evil is good  there is deception on every front give jesus a chance  there is nothing but truth in the word 
yaku niku book read
isn t a fear of death natural too  if it s ingrained in basically every living animal then i d think that would nature
stoicism sounds so cool until you start actually thinking about it
pewdiepie is better 
pewds   once your broke 100m  it no longer mattered to the world  you broke that milestone  just as roald amundsen was the first to reach the south pole  others followed  but you were the first  so take your  w  and let others follow in your footsteps 
this is the most bait title i ve ever read  and i love it 
did not you say the n word 
accidents happen  
 suave605 so that is an excuse for being racist 
we want mr beast diss track
hey pewds  if by chance you see this  i would recommend reading more modern aristotelians who run with some of the premises of nicomachean ethics but develop them and make it more compatible with developments in philosophy and science  some of my favourite virtue ethicists are iris murdoch  philippa foot  martha nussbaum  and elizabeth anscombe 
how did we start from happy wheels and end up here  
amazing bro  
bro look up marcus tullius cicero 
 six mistakes mankind keeps making century after century  believing that personal gain is made by crushing others  worrying about things that cannot be changed or corrected  insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it  refusing to set aside trivial preferences  neglecting development and refinement of the mind  attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do     marcus tullius cicero
 times are bad  children no longer obey their parents  and everyone is writing a book  
i grew alongside pewds  i was too the guy who brought up the double slit experiment in every conversation
pewdiepie needs to do something about this he cannot die
happy wheels part 200 would ve been  1 trending for sure
how  when  what 
this video feels like it is sponsored by some cool book s
i will eat up these book reviews every single time 
i love buddhism  i am christian but i think we should be mre like buddhists  i have a buddhist temple near me  i am going to visit it this summer
you should stick to the word that you know in your heart  do not let the world deceive you of the truth
i fucking love felix s book reviews  probably my fav series of his  it s so calming and fun to watch felix ramble on about his interpretations and ideas he gathers from the books he reads  not to mention i get some good recommendations  <3 much love pewds  been here for 9 years 
la alih ala allah
pewds  do not take my legs pewdiepie legs confirmed 
repetition legitimizes  repetition legitimizes repetition legitimizes
pewds translate all you vids in all languages especially spanish  you ll be top dog in no time  
book review is back  
he dud deez in while go 
i legit said pewdiepie 10 000 times to stop mrbeast and he doesint care
craving can also be purpose  
mr  beast creates bigger scale content   what does pewdiepie do that every other streamer does not do 
this was actually very cool and interesting
can you send me all the books you mentions i m broke
thought it was friday for a second there
you are gfuel flavor is my favorite  i am now the pewdiepie gfuel monster  half sour half regular 
this is what we call a perfect clickbait     
you officially have ligma
no c s lewis 
if you find nietzsche s work hard to read but love his poetic words  i suggest you read  thus spoke zarathustra   also sprach zarathustra  this is a philosophical novel written by him and it is an absolute beauty with very strong quotes and lessons 
more of these please  even small individual 5 min vids of books  we love these videos so much 
legends never die
boring why do not he prove himself
read the quran  you will find it interesting
diss track when 
love you brother   
i don t get it  he s not entertaining lol
it is not a surprise  when pewds first hit 100mil  he stopped trying to grow his channel  he stopped trying to spread out  he was content with what he had  so he focused on making content for the people that were there  not the people that he could bring in
too bad you failed        all the other  poor swedens must be heartbr ken   
pewdiepie > mr beast
first time i watch you  you seem entertaining for the algorithm  do you still think bad of t series   not expecting you to reply at all 
everyone subscribe to pewdiepie he is overcursing the bad words so just subscribe to him so let him beat mr beast
i m not surprised mrbeast is just like that
bible review next please
when pewdiepie doing book review his editor are in relax mode 
sounds like my philosophy professor
manga review
you made it to the top because of skill  he just bought his way there 
books   buddah s words  the nicomachean ethics  enchiridion  the gay science  read beyond good and evil first   our mathematical universe and of course   this books loves you
while buddhism sees the world s suffering as constant and teaches a way to minimalize it  christianity sees the suffering in the world as temporary and offers a way out permanently  since you have read  buddha s words  you might be interested in the opposite side of this philosophy since they contrast so well  authors like paul washer and billy graham excluding his auto biographys  really give insight to how jesus viewed suffering and what he taught on the subject  edit  the reason i bring these authors up instead of the straight up bible is because you mentioned a lot of repetition in  buddha s words  and the bible has a lot of repetition lol but these authors i mentioned above deliver the same message in a more consise way   i hope this helps pewds  
if mrbeast deletes his channel and makes a new one  he can upload two videos per day for a year  i wonder if he would get the 100 million subscribers back within a year 
ah  with all mr beasts channels combined  his sub count probably surpassed yours a while back
me   mr beast passed pewdiepie in subs  my girlfriend   who is mr beast  she is the one
please  we need more of this 
epictetus  yes  very exquisite name indeed
11 58 wait what   0
honestly for anyone thinking of getting into nietzsche please start with thus spoke zarathustra  any other book as an intro might turn you off 
i really enjoy this content and absolutely needed to hear this  i truly hope you make more of these 
what is  s ubs  have not heard of it 
11 56    so  this is how we stand right now     mrbeast  tweet said it loud and clear  right    mrbeast  umpf   solution  move all of the videos to a new channel mrbeastnew and delete the first one  you always keep your word  right          daaamn  i want to see jimmy s response to that  lol  we all for sure do not want him to delete the channel of course  but it is fun as always 
i never expect the number 1 gamer ever to speak philosophy  this is truly the peak of the internet
you are still the best youtuber everrrrrr love you
good video man  thanks for all the recomends 
damn rip pewdiepie s popularity  still never figured out how he got so popular 
i have declared 
its okay pewds  100 of those 115mil are probably children below 15 anyway
something else you should look into is shamanism
pewds will always be the true og  but both of them are true legends
always will be  1
pls do happy wheels part 200  
bro it s so crazy pewdiepie had more then mr  beast for some time just for being himself and he never did a mr  beast styled video like the rest of youtube  that s an achievement in itself now it s all about the challenges 
i feel bad for you  champ  but keep doing what you like 
do manga review next
what a waist  mans washed up everyone is passing him in subs and to say i was routing for this guy omg so embarrassed right now let us go mr  beast 
why is mr beast even famous   we all know pewds is the goat 
have not watched a pewdiepie video in years  lost in an endless ocean of dark feelings today  still managed to make me laugh with a stupid kelly clarkson joke  thank you felix 
well  of course  you are barely doing anything anymore  because you are past the stage where youtube is your main goal  whereas br  meast is at the stage where you were around 7 years ago  it was a matter of time for him to surpass you 
4 53
l s bibeln
felix give us the beard back
bro y the jokes in this video hit so hard
this is my fav content from pewds i love the philosophy and book vids
mr beast has gone more corporate though kind of like t series so i still see pewds as top solo youtuber
 
it seems like the bandicam has returned
pewds is like that porn actor  my man s has done it all 
me not realizing the enchiridion was a real book and not jus something adventure time made up
i think you need more s ubs
i declare   southern accent 
happy wheels happy wheels pleaaaaseee 
anything negative and that affects people negatively is  bad  like  just because it is nature  does not make eating animals alive good  that involves torture and pain  although not deliberate like humans  but i feel like the animals have to realize the animal is in pain 
if you haven t already done so  watch the good place  you re welcome 
jimmy has betrayed pewds  the end is coming
i am joking
i tuned out for a second and now he is  philosophypilled  did not i click on a video about him and mrbeast and subscribers 
pewds is still the biggest youtuber  mr beast is a whole team 
read the quran read the quran read the quran just read it
when he said  bit i have a trick up my sleeve  i thought he was going to make a joke distract on mr beast
book reviews slap
this video is a great example of how to pursue the truth and not listen to the followers of it 
why does not he just read the bible then   
my favourite type of pewdiepie videos
pewdiepie  have you heard about the ship of theseus 
a sad time 
good video  can you please play god of war ragnarok 
i noticed that stoicism is very similar to some of the principles and beliefs of islam in the way that death is not evil and hard times are just  a test  you should read a translated version of the quran   some of the things in the translated version may seem wrong but that is from the inconsistencies  of the translations 
tl dr
happy wheels better
you ll be big in our hearts  
but pewdiepie lord felix is the first youtuber that gained 100 million subscribers by himself right    or he has a little team   i mean mr beast jimmy has a big team toally like we have seen a lot of his team in videos i do not know   
stoicism is not about other people not controlling your actions its about other people or circumstances not controlling your emotions which turn into actions 
   
i love the slower pace to this video it gave me some much needed   peace  
yea but you been doing it for a lot longer from gaming videos  vlogs  anything you can think of  you also do not buy your subscribers like mrbeast  i know it do not matter to you but your channel is better in 200 million ways
listening to a rich person talk about happiness for 12 minutes xd do not get me wrong  the ideas you are talking about are wonderful  but for those of us who are not as privileged  they are just ideas 
felix it s not over until you say it s over 
read coran
how about closet review  3
this is just my favorite type of videos  so wholesome to see a fellow book lover trying to explain complicated premises with silly anecdotes to get his fellow humans interested in philosophy xd
if you liked the gay science  you should definitly read the twilight of the idols by nietzsche  best nietzsche book i am going to
i mean you did say the n word
this video is so goddamn good  amazing succinct but still overall the gist spot on of each work  and reading the original works and sources instead of some watered down  contemporary reinterpretation  absolutely based
it is that year of the time we all waited for  book review 
felix  have some damn kids and homeschool them  be like aristotle and make the next alexander 
mr beast more like mrs beast  pewds foreverrr  i have declared 
can we get a happy wheels part 200 plz
man do not stop making videos we miss you 
yo pewds
yes  book review 
2 08 that is not better the burger is best  
even if mr beast or any other youtuber had a billion subscribers  you will be the king of youtube forever in my heart 
it is been 5 hours since this video was posted and mr  beast s channel is still up   dramatic music intensifies 
1 45 that is not what i was thinking  i was thinking how is it a consequence  like it is completely the person s fault  things happen and things can be sh t   i immediately thought like when people say  why do not homeless people just get jobs 
do not read books  eat shrooms and write them 
we love you felix you make us laugh you are my  1
i am surprised you did not see this coming
entertainment happy wheels 2000 sounds pretty good 
entendi poha nei uma nesse v deo kkk
felix we love you and marzia  by the way you have retired  so being number 1 does not matter as much  enjoy your golden years  book reviews make me happy  keep doing them until you get tired of them 
here before title change cuz typo ticket   
i do not watch because of how many subscribers you have  i watch because you are still the most entertaining youtuber in my mind and the most real  please do not stop making videos any time soon
book review is the best content in you repertoire 
gigachad
i love you papa pewds  you are 40 year man now  
clickbait
you are the greatest of all time felix  i love you
yess i adore book review  felix is our number one forever
l bozo
pewds will always be  1   i ve seen like 2 of mr beasts videos and i got super annoyed within a minute of them  also pewds is actually committed to this he posts many different types of content and uploads every week where as mr beast just posts every so often  i will forever watch pewdiepie i ve grown up with his videos and i dedicated all my school art work about his channel like back in middle school i actually made a bro fist out of clay   i also use to imitate his voice all the time with my best friend  and in high school i made a full portrait of him  he s relatable   and really funny and i will always enjoy the adventure he has taken us on in his content  
the ending  i didn t know jimmy had said that
as impossible as it may seem  a one last grind fight for  1 from pewds would be spectacular 
sub to pewdiepie pandemic part 2
s ubs
max tegmark  woooo  
the soy mr beast   exploits and uses a bunch of poor people for entertainment by waving lofty amounts of wealth in front of their face  the chad pewdiepie   book  happy wheels  just a lil bit of cringe  as a treat 
can t wait for happy wheels pt200
i would love to sleep on epic tities
watching you read all these philosophers  books  it feels good  you are learning from all these individuals and you have gained a positive mentality  your unbiased attitude towards all these philosophers makes me want to suggest you to read about prophet muhammad s life  i am sure it will help you attain more contentment 
broski your title has a typo   
your awesome man
now all we got to do is get mr  beast above tseries  pewds could not do it  but he shure can pass the torch 
as someone who grew up watching felix and always looked up to him  it is so great to see his venture into philosophy as that was always my favourite subject
wow sieve really makes him look smart here
still the goat  love the content to this day  i ve been watching you since 2013  feel like i ve grown up with you  keep up the uploads and pls bring back book review for realsies
is pewlosopsy a recognized field of study yet 
thank you pewds for the best philosophy book of all time  
take the greek philosophers and add the teachings of jesus christ and you get st  thomas aquinas  definetly a top 3 thinkers of all time  read some of that  
post content like mr beast to pass him
youtube king 
there is always a 3rd option for views  invite william and kevin back and then destroy your car again  that was pretty entertaining the first time lol 
i know this is a bad opinion but i do not understand why people read books these days  there are many more better and accessible ways to gain knowledge in the modern era  we have visual books now and audio books  i think listening to a book is much more entertaining than reading the book  i mean if you are a multitasker like me you can just work out or something at the same time or do anything else and save time  just my opinion and i hope i will not get much hate for it 
why am i genuinely angry that mr beast has passed pewds in subscribers 
was the edit long of mrbeast just grow fast af he is already at 118m
he is like an older brother we never get  but if you look properly  our brothers is him except less successful 
no matter how many people pass you in subs you will always be  1 in our hearts
all our favourite things ever   anti buddhism 101   i am writing a sci fi fantasy novel about this actually  happy to send you a copy   
why do you hate norwegians  
you are always the king of youtube 
pewd is european so obviously he s better
felix s channel is the cozy fireside armchair that you may not always use but you are just happy it is there to be your comfy spot whenever it is needed
perfect analogy
you are still king to the ones who matter  
ah  here we go again 
honestly i never read philosophy books  never interested in them as well simply because most of the philosophies seems like a guide to life  just like the bible is to christians  but if you live long enough you will also start to develop your own philosophies which would coincide with what ancient philosphers were thinking which is why their works are still very relevant   basically if you just keep living you will get to know more about yourself and the world the longer you stay living  though tbf about it  we all have those moments of feeling lost and having a guide would be a great help  but personally  i still believe so long as you keep living you will develop your own principles  whether it is good or bad is up to each person after all
you will forever be remembered as the king of youtube rest easy in your retirement 
happy wheels part 200 when 
s ubs
fake account  may be
still  1 individual because mrbeast is basically a group
could i still get the happy wheels part 200   
tank intoo the miic  i try to listen what you are saying without trying 2 switch my volume every 3 seconds 
pewdiepie x mr beast collab 
e
f
i noticed that and i was honeslty pretty angry  br beast is a   beast  at marketing all of his vids but you still  1 to me
well he kind of became a company   reailty series of some sort  so pewds still the number one youtuber which is doing everything solo  apart from editing 
w or l
cannot believe this is the same guy who screams ay barrels  i am getting old
thanks
i love these videos
he gives out money and expensive things you give great content you win pewds
i am waiting fir the review of the big mustache man
i have a question do you have a girl channel
both people i have been watching for almost a decade now  crazy
to be fair he already passed you in subs due to multiple channels a long time ago 
s ubs
c s lewis mere christianity is a great read especially trying to understand morals
2 35 even just space but felix born as vikhangz  he lyfes in valhalla not buddhism or christian fantasies
<33
trinston was here 
pewdiepie vs mr beast 1000m subscribers challenge
to be honest i do not want to die  ever  so i have decided to become a robot and live until the sun expoldes
do happy wheels pt 200 anyways
it s actually crazy that the thumbnail says 112 mil  the photo in the video says 115  and he already is at 117 mil  insane how fast he grows  but he definitely deserves it
now   118 mil 
 rushhorizon jesus i just looked and it was 117 how is it already 118   
 thefilmschlock its very fast 
mr beast distrack when 
pewds i suggest to you to read the quran it has everything you will need to know in life in general
minecraft book review hmmmmm 
if anybody is interested with buddhism you might want to checkout the qur an   this is coming from seeing reviews of  people reading about different faiths  people that resonates with christianity or buddhism usually resonates with the qur an as well   you might heard about islam  you might have seen muslims  but have you tried reading the qur an  i love studying religions  i have read the bible and studied buddhism as well as other religions 
bro if you re reading that much give the quran a try  it is not a book of science  but has science facts that were discovered before scientists knew  like the expansion on the universe
based  
i do not know if you really want to say good and bad does not exist because that would imply a lot of things being okay when society would say it is not  
happy wheels part 200 for fuxk sake
what is with his voice  seems unhealthy i think
you will always be the king of youtube in my heart pewdiepie
i am glad that you are still making this kind of videos  they are very chill and informative  thank you   
he s held the top for many many years and it was bound to happen  beast is popular for the same reason pewdiepie was popular 
i really enjoyed this video thank you  
since he doesn t care let s all unsubscribe to put him at 69 million
bruh i asked for this before i guess the gods were listening
t seires is at 231 million lol  
i am against this promotion of a religion here
i love the message of people chasing freedom  i think many of us in our attempt to achieve something become enslaved by it and end up exactly where we wished not to be  i love these videos and how felix explains them  i think these topics and ideas are essential for self reflection 
i seen like 2 3 mr beast vids recently  i had no idea who he was till recent  but pewdiepie  been watching him since 2012 or something  lol
you are still the most subscribe individual on youtube   wink   wink 
wait  so google maps does not work in japan 
you still have more total views   you  28 billion   mr beast  19 billion 
big brain
even though mrbeast has beat you in subscribers you will always be the best pewds
boring 
unsubbing after 10 years of being subbed  you done it pewds  you now make irrelevant  unfunny  unmotivated videos  your time as king is well over  infact you have overstayed your welcome on youtube  thanks for a decade of entertainment
0 31 book 1  in the buddha s words  an antholoy of discources from the pali canon 3 20 book 2  nicomachean ethics  by aristotle 5 38 book 3  epictetus enchiridion  by epictetus 8 00 book 4  the gay science  by friedrich nietzsche 9 56 book 5  our mathematical universe  my quest for the ultimate nature of reality  by max tegmark 11 38 book 6  this book loves you  by pewdiepie hopes this helps anyone looking for the books 
ngl i was actually really hyped for the book reviews  i love books ahaha
you ever see a video that is so good you just want to give it like an extra special like or smth  this is one of m  absolute masterpiece thank you felix
the old king is  gone  long live the king
love you pewdiepie
pewdie pie you been stuck at 111m subs
i have been loving that tshirt since the morgz video 
and happiness should not be a goal in itself
a collab between felix and pewdiepie would be so epic fr 
i kind of disagree  money and fame cannot be taken away like that 
we we die live
 mrbeast passes felix in subs  felix   you know what i like more than subs  knowledge 
pewdiepie vs mr beast challenge
jimmy did not beat felix in my opinion  he is simply carrying the youtube story into a new chapter 
who just wants to sleep forever peacefully without being disturbed
 mrbeast and pewdiepie fighting for top spot in subscribers   sive   i see this as an absolute win 
should of done happy wheels part 200  smh 
that idiot passed you  you are way better than him
you will always be my number one
nooooo   
just because he passed in subs doesn t make him funnier  
can we have ahppy weels
the sun is a mass of incandescent gas  a giant nuclear furnace 
wait  he passed you in s ubs  cannot believe it
this is like t series all over again
screw mr beast  you re still the best mr pewdipewds 
det d r med t nderna  r ingenting  jag kommer inte ih g vem  men en av dessa  antika stofiler  sa n t i likhet med  intelligens hos en kvinna  r som en ko med tv  huvuden eller n t s nt  kul  hahahaha  s   undrar hur l nge det dr jer innan n n kommer o s ger n t i stil med att  och  han har r tt tycker jag 
wewe dielive
book review 
great to see you back my man  i am extremely happy that you are able to live in japan  
like father like son  jimmy has surpassed felix with his great mentorship
i watch some of your videos but i do not follow you  
l
ah felix has become wise good to see i recommend anyone to get into philosophy and self development i used to think that stuff was  gay  but in reality to be a great man or women you must learn and develop yourself otherwise you ll be a lesser human much love to you all in your journey in life
your the   
 
still waiting for a arthur shopenhauer review
a day for the history books
honestly i miss old pewdiepie  when we got earaped  cried of laughter and really wanted to be like him  nowdays he is to chill  not the same  that is why his no longer the worlds biggest youtube channel  i am sad that mrbeast have beaten you in subscribers  that would not have been the case if he was like the old pewdiepie   old pewds reminds me of speed for some reason 
bro he grew up  he started youtube as an immature teen and now he s a married man
dammmmmm
love book 
what i learned today  sleep on epic tiddies
i do hope that you at least read the qur an
compared to mr beast   t series or coco melon   felix still comes out on top  they may have larger numbers but his production cost is relatively low compared to the rest of those media giants
where s the diss track 
pewdipie actually has character  is funny and is not scared of being contraversial  mr beast is the complete opposite  he is one of the most boring people on the internet and that is a polite way of putting it 
hype af for book review
mr beast does not deserve to the  1  
he is not
mr soyboy you mean
mrbeast is bound to fail at some point anyway  the bubble must burst eventually
existential crysis
kind of sad that jimmy passed pewd i do not hate the guy but his content mostly revolve around giving money to people and for me that got old fast pewd almost felt like  that one friend  in some weird way 
lol
i feel like felix has never truly looked into islam  he voices all these disagreements and agreements with buddhism  and he seems to end up agreeing with islamic ideologies on life 
i am sure felix checked marsia s teeth to make sure the google is not lying  
thank you bro i start my earning just like you content    love you
pewdiepie have 111 m of subscribers
this philosophy
pewdiepie is real mr  beast for us 
why do you look tired 
can you pls replay and i was wanting to say   you might pass t series
but mr  beast has a company
you are evolving  growing  and still humble  however  you are still the biggest youtuber 
this is why real bros will hang here till death
we have got to make sure pewds reclaims his spot  hack mr beast s channel 
diss 
mrbeast went from  sub to pewdiepie  to being larger than pewdiepie but jokes aside thank you felix and jimmy for changing millions of lives over the course of these past few years
why do not you read the most read and memorised book in the whole world 
my life has changed because i have been earning  15 250 returns from my  4 000 investment with darien 
wow  i have seen a lot of recommendations about darien  is he that good 
i am from denver colorado usa  i connected with him and he has helped me a lot  he makes so much profit for me  he made success earlier than i thought 
dang last move
let us gooooo book review
mrbeast shall inherit the task of surpassing t series
impossible to surpass them now  perhaps some other megacorp can do it in the next decades 
 altsekbul i do not see why but ok
you should read  homo ludens  a study of the play element in culture  there is also a latin version available if you want so summon deamons at the same time while reading the book 
thank you for educating the youth
buddhism is fake
yes book review 
i m a full blown christian and i ve never read buddha s stuff  but it s kind of funny to see how similar buddhism s ideas are to some of the things jesus said  obviously jesus said a lot of other important things about how to live  but it s kind of like this philosopher guy came to a really similar conclusion to what jesus said all along in a way 
your not number 1 anymore
mr beast isn t even one person honestly when he s had a whole cast and a production team for his grandiose videos where as pewdiepie has stayed the same just sitting down and playing video games just like the average joe which is wholesome
watch mr beast watch this and make a video titled  un sub for king pewds  with the thumbnail of pewds saying mr beast has more subs than him
lol
i will happily join pewdiepie book club channel subscribe
your a big late lol he s at 118m now and gaining lots
youtube is pewdiepie
everything has its seasons 
i know he earned it but  ahh the king is being dethroned again  
haven t seen copium thumbnail since the stardew stream after coco melon diss got taken down
 peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewdiepie 
pewdiepie will always be my  1 guy  i have watched him since i first started to watch youtube videos  dude is very special to me
happy wheels part 200 would ve been better
good video
i enjoyed this video a lot more than most recent ones  nice to hear stuff like this from pewds 
04 03 wow  it is just like pewdiepie s tuber simulator 
the fact that mrbeast at 1m subs looked up the pewdiepie and made so many videos trying to get people to sub to him it s so awesome and mrbeast gets that return pewdiepie makes a video on him you will always be  1 felix   
6 25 it is especially a useless emotion  when you want to keep slaves  regardless of corporate slaves or regular slaves 
every og here will be subbed to mr  beast and vice versa 
the bible solos all the other religious books
did you read anything by neil degrasse tyson 
 life is like a ferris wheel  even when you are down  just remember there is always a way back up  both of you create tons of joy to us  do not be discourage  
 congrats to jimmy  
tbf mrbeasts videos are very little effort or creativity  his entire career is just summed up with  money 
mr beast has subs because he throws money around and a bunch of kids sub in hopes of making cash and his videos are shallow af 
more book review pls  
i am happy  i like mr beast so much better
lol i am sry that literally just made my day  i know you are not pewdiepie incase you did not realize  that comment is just funny
these will forever be my favorite videos 
4 45 i do not even have accounts there 
nice click bait
bro stoicsim all the way
transition from gamer to drama king  to life coach 
i feel like i am in my first year course all over again
mrbeast dis track 
he said he does not care about how many subs he has
pewdiepie   take my legs  jokes on you there are none 
would you read the quraan ik its religiouse and exc but take a read
it doesn t matter if he used to be on top but what matter is he was the first to be at the y top and lasted the longest on top
pewds is still the single best creator out there who doesn t need to creat a huge brand out of himself with a lot of employees
plz do happy wheels
pewdiepie can you read the king james version of the holy bible i am interested in your review of it
you want your copium  okay  here it is  look at the money he had to spend to do it 
10 05 a slow cooked joke  on pewdiepie s channel  omg i am going to cry
come on pewds  time  to learn spirituality   i know you will see my comment  now since you are no longer the king of youtube
well you have go long way and from sweden you end up to dream place japan it nice clean place and i want to travel over there to see it natural areas and mostly history is super nice its so clean
mrbeast has gone so corporate it s insane  i miss his old days  can t say i actually dislike him now  but i certainly don t like him 
the real number 1 
it is so sad he passed in s ubs
felix tricked me into watching a video about philosophy books and i thoroughly enjoyed every second of it  this man has unstoppable power
comments on human centipede  your video dp so good 
i stay  you like my best friend or older brother 
felix  after many years gets passed in subs felix soon after   i do not care about subs anymore  still ly though <3
for anyone who enjoys philosophy or enjoys learning about it or are brand new to i found a podcast that starts with the earliest western philosophers and work its way to current day  philosophize this  is the title 
what a king
congratulations to mr beast  his wholesome channel gets more better and better 
mr beast is just a fad and a bad one  the obsession with money is honestly disgusting
wait do we sleep on epic titties or not  i want to know  
i am getting out of old ways of thinking and losing destructive mental and physical habits  definitely going to check these books out  thank you felix  i really admire and look up to you brochaucho
we need a collab like smosh and  3 with mr beast for the official pass
i haave waited for this for soooo long      
i love how i watched karl s minecraft video and made me think of pewdiepie  even though he obviously is not a minecraft creator  but it is hilarious that the first video i check is this interesting  he really has such a wide variety of content  this one i really liked honestly  so interesting and gave me a lot to think about  kind of makes me feel bad for unsubscribing every now and then  this video and many others are amazing but sometimes i just get a little sick of the whole reacting to stuff troupe  so the daily upload featuring these kind of videos makes me unsubscribe usually  but that is not why i am leaving the comment  i just wanted to say i really enjoyed this video  i guess one the reasons the concepts of multiple realities and other ideas being still interesting today after many days  is because sure  we have electricity now and so many more inventions  but that is ultimately just a fraction of all the things we are capable of  or at least i would hope so  i doubt we will be able to travel dimensions but i mean  people from the fast doubted in the ability to fly so  who knows
boring brah 
i said it once ill say it again read nihilism by serafim rose
i want to start reading
i ve been waiting for book review for so long i am so hyped
mr beast is no longer an individual  it is a company  pewdiepie the goat individual youtuber
kids these days  little s ts
you are always  1
yeeeesss book review  
s ubs 
i really appreciate this video  thank you for talking about this  felix  those are such great books and there are tons more that are fantastic if you are suffering  great video     death is natural  and nothing natural is evil 
 mr beast take over pewdiepie  pewdiepie  we are going to talk about happiness and anger  
i wish my suffering was just from cravings   not mental illness
me waiting for the distract just for fun  my mind  nothing personal jim but i got to go out just this once
what is this 
maybe mr beast will conquer t series
yo the craving as suffering mindset is actually going to help me with resisting my junk food addiction  ty ty
yes pewdiepie philosophy
damn  pewdiepie lost 
happpppy wheels
mrbeast is the best
i still think of pewds as the individual creator with the highest sub count  mr beast is a whole 100  person production nowadays 
true to be honest
 mr beast just passed me in subs so we are going to talk about buddhism now 
read all 3 holy religions  and make an episode about it  
felix will always be number 1
book   review  
here before mrbeast comments back  
felix even if mr beast has more subs then you it dosent mind your a much better youtuber i prefer to watch you
 bro you could have just checked  you had a wife  to be fair given the times his wife was probably like 14 and did not have wisdom teeth out yet making the count less than his own
all who have  this book loves you  may like this comment
book review
i was waiting  hoping  for a book review vid from pewdiepie  i nearly did not click this clickbait vid xd so glad i did  wish he went more in depth though  
i wish i could say that i watched felix from the beginning  from before he was  famous  or whatever  but that would be a lie  i did start 10 years ago though and i am glad i did  i first watched him play the first walking dead game by telltale games  the one where you play as lee everett  ever since then i have been watching him  one of the greatest youtubers in my opinion  mr  beast is great  but there is a reason even jimmy is inspired by felix
cocomelon still has more then mrbeast
cocomelon is a company not a person
 prodromosmakpon8432 does not matter  the subs do
i came for pewdiepie  i stayed for the wise teachings 
take that mr beast 
did anyone else think that pimple on pewd s lip got bigger and bigger throughout this video  i am scratching to pop that bitch   
felix you would enjoy reading the gospels or the entire bible or just the torah 
you ll always be our  1 pewds 
i love you pewds
why is the quality so bad like you recorded it off your phone  
love the book reviews
mr beast dis track coming up guys
has felix lose weight  take care my brother 
read about islam  you will not regret it  start with the quran  english translation since the quran is in arabic 
on the contrary  i find the more i understand the world scientifically  the more amazing it gets  the world is visually beautiful  but it is breath taking when you start to understand how it spins 
pewdiepie my neighbors are trying to rape me     
o
mr beast on his way to make the dumbest most goofiest thumbnails known to man
been waiting on a book review again glad to see we finally got one
yes women had less teeth back then it been proven by the theory of richard darwin women are evolving
buddhism or any other book will not make you better  the quran should be the top book you should read if you want to know the meaning of life
mr beast diss track 
i feel like pewdiepie having 111m subs is good because it is a nice number 
after 12 years i finally realized that pewdiepie was not american
okay  aristotle s wife lost some teeth  and instead of admitting she ate too much sugar like a little kid  she was like  nah  women just have fewer teeth  you did not know that  that is got to be it
i hate mr beast because his videos is boring and disgusting
what i wouldn t give to see happy wheels again 
this really symbolises the passing of the old yt ways to the new ones  the end of an era really
science is mostly stuff you do not need to know  it is actually beneficial if we did not know most of it  now some of it would come under the developments of modern medicine but even at that  with vaccines it can actually to the reverse and affect you badly  science should be descaled at least for now until our thinktanks stop thinking for us 
more than half a million views in 4 hours is impressive
why so short   
should have reviewed blood meridian
you are still   forever will be the king of youtube  beast needs a team of people to help him  you did it alone  and that will always be remarkable 
do not forget brad 1 and brad 2
technically he did have a time at one point in time when he was at the height of his career 
 bruhbruh6408 you say that  yet you are a public subscriber of felix  not to mention  you have spammed the comment section with this message 
 bruh bruh how can you say you are better when you are clearly acting like a trash 
mrbeast did it alone too for like 8 years
at least beast has a team so that means he is easy to work with  probably  joking aside  i think they both deserve it in their own way 
 aligmal5031  i do not blame him  his fans are quite  interesting  people
t series delete the channel now 
pewdiepie promised a diss track when mr beast passed him  well technically a song congratulating him 
life is suffering
hehhehee hehheeeh heeehhhee funny rip bozo do better next time skull
so basically  if i want to feel better  i need to actually do something other than watch youtube videos and smoke weed  this is going to be a tough 
wow she smokes weed so cool  not 
subscribes since 2015
we love you felix
we want happy wheels part 200 now
mr beast does not have subscribers he has people in greed of money
you can tell his mad   
i really like optimistic nihilism and think that s the philosophy i will prescribe to the most at the present  it may change in the future but at the moment it resonates  stoicism really does help to let go of things you can t control   like peoples perception of yourself  but to follow it in full is not ideal 
everyone is in here complimenting and commenting to pewdiepie with their  notice me senpai  vibes  but i have not seen this mf interact with a single youtube comment in at least 5 years  think about it  when is the last time you saw felix reply to or thumbs up anything in his own comment sections  he straight up does not care anymore lol
felix passing the torch to mrbeast through philosophy is the best thing ever   you ll always be  1 in our hearts felix  edit  aristotle is awesome
love you videos  felix  speaking of philosophy and theology  i am curious to see your conclusion on the examination of the four gospels  matthew  mark  luke  and john  in other words  what do you think about jesus christ really living  dying  and rising from the dead   here is the hook  he claimed to be god he promises eternal life after death  if you repent and put your faith in him  i hope you will consider looking into it  i am curious to see your reaction 
20 hours left 
ahhh buddhism preaching about suffering while causing suffering to millions
it is just like christianity except cool 
finally the top youtuber isn t racist
i have declared
i ve loved this new era of felix  it s seriously just posting whatever he wants  and also i think we get to see his personality more  he s in his jenna marbles s  i am a 32 year old lady  phase where she did whatever she wanted  i miss her so much    
me too    but you are right  i like this phase of youtuber careers 
anyone else glad that he did not start any beef with mr beast  loved this video  what a way to pass on the sub crown to mr beast 
pewdiepie is holding the world hostage right now
aristotle s wife might have been short a few teeth  he might not have been scientifically educated to the point where he instinctively knew not to draw any conclusions from anecdotal evidence  if he had 10 wives  possibly he would have known better 
did you know that while buddha was alive so was jesus christ  just a fun fact 
read hpb  that is helena blavatsky 
mr  beast pulled off the ultimate slipstream  
you lost becouse mrbeast have lot of languages of his video
i am going to miss mrbeast   
happy wheels 200   i m absolutely fucking for it
mrbeast gone give hos youtube channel away
pewdiepie still number one youtuber of a team of less than a couple people 
best video ever
i love you pewds and whatever happens i will never forget you  you gave me my childhood  i used to watch your videos till 3am every night   i was so tired for school the next day   i am 22 now and live by myself with an amazing job   furure ahead of me  but i will always remember the massive part you played in my childhood  
happy wheels  
1 54 why doesn t felix have the pewdiepie case on  is there something wrong with the product 
i like how you are slowely starting to grasp the extent of you are reach  a tiny bit to late but  b ttre sent  n aldrig 
we actually need more of those vids 
literally yesterday i was thinking that it was almost time for another book review
mr  beast is most humblest and does lot of charity  he has a 2nd channel too that dedicated to charity 
i am soo happy you talked about buddhism  eventhough i am not very religious  i really respect the philosophy behind buddhism  it teaches a lot about life 
this homestly must feel so good for pewds  he always said its lonely at the top 
think it is time to move to odysee mate 
do happy wheels
imagine there are places out there in the big universe that people will never discover  we will never see the beauty of those  other  places just makes me sad thinking about it 
mr beast once said that he will delete his channel if he surpasses pewdiepie  so
pewds please give dostoevsky a chance 
pewds is still the better looking youtuber 
duffering
1 53 my god i found moist critikals alternate personality
you ll always be  1 in our hearts 
mr beast seeing the title probably cried
i do not care cope
i fear death so much that i am scared to sleep at night  this vid kind of helped me get over the fear
si supiera hablar english xd
mr beast may have surpassed felix in subs  but he did not raise us 
i love the book reviews 
i love your book reviews pewds it s my favorite of your new content  
book review yes
this video changed my life
the books mentioned sauran  buddha and tolkien is sure an unexpected crossover 
s ubs
 good or bad doesn t exist  it s something we made up   i don t know felix  i d argue that there are concrete ethical laws made by god 
meisel  peter et al   women are periodontally healthier than men  but why do not they have more teeth than men   menopause  new york  n y  vol  15 2  2008  270 5  doi 10 1097 gme 0b013e31811ece0a they do have less teeth on average  pewdiepie  the greatest philosopher
you are still my number 1 youtuber  in my heart
you re very wise and have actually grown with your audience  you ll always be the youtube g o a t 
he s high as fuck 
nah the bro army never going to stop joining felix wether you pushing for subs or not  man s can literally do a game play through and break the internet let s be real here 
live life good  do not live forever bad  literally buddha 
waiting for the deletion of mr  beast s channel
a follow up for those interested in buddhism but do not want to go straight into the meat of it   i would recommend reading jack kerouac  in particular   wake up  which is a compendium of the teachings of the buddha   on the nature of life  desire  wisdom  and suffering  it is slightly easier to digest because it is written by a westerner and it compiles buddhism s teachings into a linear story and progression 
really loving the aggressive energy of todays book review
felix is becoming jaiden smith with this insane amount of knowledge  watch out
if you want happiness then you should read the al quran with meaning
the nietzshe podcast by untimley reflections is really good to get into  pewdiepie
read  between shades of grey  shit was so good
 pewdiepie  you should read the  nine cloud dreams   when buddhism was beginning to spread to korea  pretty interesting to see the developing of different kinds of buddhism 
feels sad man
this is not legal  pewds is 1
ez
1 25 8 15 wat do
yes  i love book review
happy wheels pls
everyone unsub from mr beast hurry 
you might as well play final fantasy 7 in order to learn buddism  just saying 
we love book review <3
1 54 i feel personally attacked
these are my favorite videos  you will always be number 1 for me felix 
mr beast work very hard to produce quality content  he does not sit at basement
to be honest mr beast is overrated imho  prob younger subs  he s vid are fun but its not memorable  but felix  its life 
i have grown up with you  pewds  appreciate the fact that you have matured with me and i can still see you around
i felt like this video was a advice for mr beast  pewdiepie is sooo kind 
pewdiepie walked so everyone could run t t
felix already finished his journey as a youtuber and gamer  right now he s just doing what he loves  in small patches  pewdiepie will forever be the supreme ruler of youtube 
maybe aristole s wife had fewer teeth than him and that is why he got it wrong 
did he just make up his own religion
 0
because you are not entertaining anymore  how is this a surprise
felix  sooo botss
when you said  i have one more trick up my sleeve  i thought you were going to say more music videos
read marx
i truly love your book reviews  so glad its back  3
thank you kelly clarkson  
upload happy wheels episode 200 
i have not actually watched a pewds vid for a while but i clicked on this because haha drama  clickbait still works in 2022  but this was so calming and has genuinely made me think about buying a couple of these books  nice vid pewds 
felix  review machiavelli  i want to know what you think  i don t agree with him on much but i loved reading him in college  he was a really unique mind who i think really understood how to control people  i know that s not similar to aristotle  but it s nice to mix philosophy up sometimes to get new perspectives
also  philosophy is my thing  when you read neitzsche  you absolutely have to watch rope by alfred hitchcock  it s a fantastic film  and it explores some of the conclusions of neitzsche s ideas about a superman
i hear war sounds and boss music  help   homeless people just get an house 
pewds is like itachi
thank you for the wisdom
never realised that felix sounds like boro
watch collection review  i know this materialistic request falls outside of your usual beliefs  but i would love to see what has interested you in the world of grand seiko the most 
beast lasagna
pewdiepie please read the bible   it is so important to read even if you are not christian or do not want to be christian   it is super interesting 
one of the problems i see in felix s view of living life to the best of your ability as it s limited it that it doesn t stop people from ruining their lives through drugs or alcoholism which have been shown to negatively impact people around those people who struggle with those things  if someone who is addicted to drugs enjoys doing the drugs and sees them as the best way to spend their life to give them their greatest enjoyment i do not know what you could say to that person
as diogenes  i beg you  felix  please talk about the suffering pewdiepie caused you from 2011 until 2021  please talk about how he kept you in the basement 
diogenes most based philosopher
hello person in getting over it
holy shit that bot is insane  never seen so much garbage
are you saying that because pewdiepie got inspired from diogenes that it actually made him more depressed 
  qxob2123 i think its holden that is kind of depressed all the time  no offense though 
no  see  he is saying that he does not know who pewdiepie is but would love to collaborate  looks like pewdiepie found him in japan and forced him to make this video  otherwise it would be a vlog  i do not think felix is safe
hey diogenes  i remember the way you dissed plato in front of his students  that was nuts 
there is like 50 bots in the replies
 do not read my profile picture ok
love
 strekozkaplays what 
book review   
i love your books reviews   please  never stop
yesssss
don t worry felix  all those kids following mr beast will grow up and discover you 
when is happywheels part 200
i love book reviews omg thank you so much  pewds
pewdiepie you are still the most subscribed independent creator
we do not care about subs subs are for newbies    
s ubs  
alright  was not expecting this  but definitely am glad i got it 
me  thinking about how pewds seems like one of the most based and mentally healthy famous people later pewds   basically do not go on twitter and insta  me  well that explains it then
ayeee book review
noice
pewdiepie will always be the man who memed his way to 100 million subs
i am a  mr beast  subscriber  but never watch his videos  to be honest not a fan of flashy  1m 10m 100m  clickbait videos  your genuine contents will always be in    thanks as always  much love <3
here before the mrbeast pinned comment 
i love pancakes 
dude i would love if you did book reviews or movie reviews  you are a connoisseur of human works of art regardless of what form they take whether it be games  books  etc  we just love to see your authentic self analyzing and enjoying these things  your purity of soul is what draws others to you 
did not mr beast say he was gunna delete his account if it surpassed pewdiepies 
you are an old man grandpa
pewdiepie  does book review  me  i was hoping for pewnews
                    
book review
pewdiepie   entertains  mr beast   throws money around everywhere and calls it charity 
111m is still a lot 
been waiting for this my fav content  
no this cannot be felix 8000                                                              felix  0
mr beast probably has wayyyy more alt accounts subbed to him do not sweat it pewds 
do industrial society and its future next  short read  popular topic  brings in clicks 
well i do not want to call you a hypocrite but  id say it is easy to talk about shit such as cravings and suffering and learning self control when basically you already live at the top  rich  accomplished  genetically blessed and married to a beautiful giving and caring wife 
pewdiepie introduced me to philosophy with his review on the art of happieness by epicurus  i was very sad person at that time and i tought   might aswell give this a try  and i bought the book  it changed me completley  and i ve ben hooked into philosophy since  every book just takes me away in a diffrent time  diffrent person  it just completley takes my mind off things  and i am very thankful for you  pewdiepie for posting a book review on the book <3
i mean pewdiepie basically built youtube s foundation  so no matter who passes him he ll always be at the top 
i love how mr  beast was the one trying to get pewdiepie subs but instead he is the big creator that helps the big creator  they are just brothers in their own way 
happy wheels
pewdiepie can get more subscribers than mr  beast if he wanted to    
yes  i have been waiting for this 
mr  beast s content is not as good as pewbiepie s content  people watch mr  beast because he gives away money and his content targets the low attention span of the current generation of young people  youtube does not care about subs anymore  it is all about watch time  i bet pew had way more watch time than mr  beast 
you raised me felix  mrbeast has nothing on you  at least in my generations eyes
my guy should of retired in 2016
wtf us this
pewds the philosopher 
rebirth amnesia
i love this video    thank you for helping us all become a better person through you are humour and your wisdom felix  i just recently started reading as well and it is helped me so much  especially in regards of my mental health  thank you for this video you should still do a happy wheels video though      keep those videos coming  we love you bro   
what are you going to do now pewdiepie  make another diss track 
man  felix should write a book 
mr beast  you mean the most recent guy from fortnite 
pewdpiepie  can you add all books in descripiton  
you can skip all of that by watching jordan petersons biblical lectures lol jk but he covers a lot of it  he read nietzsche and he understood him 
who does not need to hear this 
may be try bhagwad gita  i love it is philosophy 
damn i love buddha and meditation books buts it is almost always heshe s book or some other never heard of this one and it is from the original pali script the language in which buddha wrote this is awesome cannot wait to get it  thanks  pewds  never knew that he was into buddha and buddhism   
i really appreciate how felix s content has evolved over the years  as his fanbase grew up  so did his content  i remember watching this guys gaming videos in middle school  and now  here i am watching his book reviews in uni  crazy how time flies 
we are getting old
y ppp were getting old
i am crying at this comment  not a day goes by that i do not think about what will happen when felix retires    i want to watch sive and felix entertain until i am old
 hannah nt9xs i am confident we will se a greybearded felix one day  do not be scared young one
reallll  i was about 12 when i started watching this dude just screaming  barrels  now i am 22 in college watching this and seriously considering buying these books  specially our mathematical universe 
and we love it
well  these last few years  he is got way older than us  dude spends all his time doing grumpy reaction videos like a boomer  it is kind of sad and pathetic i am going to 
nice video  
    
what a wonderful run it s been   
i fully expected him to restart the  subscribe to pewdiepie  meme when they got close  would have been funny 
wat is this
pewdiepie  philosopher  big brain  gamer  swedish   
omg this book loves you i remember reading that  it was funny  be cool to see pewds authoring some more books of his own 
forever and always will be the goat of youtube
i mean mr beast does some super crazy videos which is why his channel subs count has just been blowing up in the past year but felix will never change as a person you are a youtube legend  the youtube god very few people have reached the 100 million subs mark and you and mr beast deserve it  as for t series with over 200 million subs i do not know i do not watch because i am not into indian music or whatever they do but i am sure they deserve it too  you all worked hard for it and should be proud regardless of whoever passes you in subs in the future     
tseries didn t deserve to win  because they cheated with sub bots and got his content banned in their country after they threw a fit over a joke song he made that they took too seriously
if good or bad doesn t exist how do i pick the good choices you were talking about secs before saying that
i do not believe
mrbeast also has less views  19 621 887 414 views  whilst pewdiepie has like 28 billion
you are legendary pewds
t series is close to 300 millon and you kids being sad over it like cry babies
i have declared that this video is about repetition 
cool books  never heard about them  which book  apart from the ones in this video  would you suggest to start reading about stoicism and nietzsche 
lmfaooo imagine mr beast actually deletes  
congratulations  d
this is why you are my favorite youtuber now  you could easily have made some overdramatic vid about trying to catch up to mr beast to try to farm views and subs  but you made a book review  respect
the mr beast channel is a large operation with a lot of manpower so pewds is still the most subscribed to channel run by a single person  unless you include editors 
mr beast vs pewdiepie  2018 felix not going to happen  2022 felix idc  
                                                             
i need a happy wheels part 200  its what how i first found your channel
the power of true 6 year olds with ipads
crazy i read the mathematical universe really good book i agree  to be honest i come back to it now after finishing a physics degree with much more appreciation and understanding for the mathematical background 
no way he deleting his channel  
  
the answer is simple  not everyone on the internet has the humour level required to understand your content 
  
the best book review title yet and in a way really appropriate with all the estoicism  buddhism  and acceptance felix mentioned
funny he just released this  i just checked yesterday to see if mr  beast had passed him in subs yet  it was multiple million though so i feel like it must have happened at least a week or two ago 
dang and i am not even subbed to mr  beast  never even seen one of his videos 
should have done happy wheels part 200
a true happiness is not feel negative emotion  virtue 
w vid
people who think felix is not religious <
w man but you are youtube years are over man you did great we are all proud
felix kjelburg wants a colab with pewdiepie
love how none of the comments even try to talk about the content of the video
  love
book review i love this content  we love you so much
try playing different games like ark
and a better and a betta itta betta
pewdiepie is talented  he worked hard for those subs  what did mr beast do to get that  give everyone money lol
buddhism   you want something  you are suffering  me   i want to live  buddhism     then you have chosen death 
we ll always be your subs zadddddyyy
so glad you do not care
make happy wheels 200 pls <3
the first immortal has already been born so that will change philosophy forever  how does someone is mind cope living as data on a computer
pewds is such big brain  he uses mr beast clickbait and then describes these serious philosophical books in such light hearted and easy to digest ways  i bet so many people are thinking about reading them now 
if you give me a car  you will regain your crown 
biggest click bair you have ever done xd good vid
he is still the individual with most subs  mr beast has like 50 warehouses and 1000 staff  pewdiepie is still the goat
happy wheels
good content and specially great script even 12 year olds will get what you r saying
mr beast is like a porn felix is like a loving husband
i thought mrbeast had like maybe 10 million subs
but mrbeast likes you  
honestly more surprised how long it took for him to pass
honestly  i used to read books  a lot  but i don t anymore  maybe i m busy with life or i m just making excuses  my life is kind of rough right now and i feel lost  my thoughts are a mess too  i do not know if it s relevant but this vid made me want to read again  esp on those philosophy books that i never read before  thanks for the review pewds  i ll def check those books out <3 also you still my  1 fav youtuber in my life  it s fascinating that i keep getting older while watching you are vids  feels like we grow up together   
mr beast pretty much pays for his subscribers so you guys are not really the same lol
 
this is like the best video
mr beast has to pass t series now
i declare  that  you have 24 hours 
happy wheel part 200 
i miss happy wheels
69k likes
why this dude looking more younger and younger in every video lol
imagine his next upload be  beast lasagna 
pewds  for me you will always be the number 1  youtuber and the biggest  mrbeast has people helping him in all of his vids  you are your own 
finally the king has returned    
this channel really grew with us and aged like fine wine    when we were in our tweens he provided us with contents for that age  now that those  tweens  are adults and so is his contents 
simp
 mentalhobo9074 a compliment is simping for you  you must be living your life hard    to better days ahead mate   cheers 
 noyce  can your nose get any browner 
 mentalhobo9074 i do not know what made you so upset that you had to leave something negative from just a statement of how i felt  from the earlier gaming contents such as happy wheels to now more of just chatting and review etc  along with some philosophy   it certainly catered to a specific target audience or it is just him growing from then to now 33    whatever is making you so sour and hateful  it will definitely get better i promise  darkest before the dawn    keep your head up mate 
bumpy lip
you should ve never went on that bridge
the direct callout at the end  
 
now pewds is maturated man
gg beast
s crates who 
unironically   this book loves you  did have some philosophy in it
god i love his  serious  videos  the dry humour and wit mixed with actually useful advice and wisdom is refreshing for youtube  especially when so much of youtube s larger channels are just reactionary garbage   ngl reactionary garbage is nice for most occasions but stuff like this is the perfect break in the insanity that i need 
shower thoughts with pewdiepie
you will go down in history as having almost as much subs as mr beast
 mr  beast  wish he could be compared to you  you have achieved all this using as little human and finantial resources as possible  whilst other channels like t series  cocomelon and even the so called  mr  beast are pretty much a whole corporation with huge production teams and a blank cheque amounts of money  and all you ever needed to succeed was a good personality and a camera  not money  i am not nor will never be subscribed to that little ostentatious daddy s boy s channel 
imagine if you have had a book by kyriakos kapakoulak  then you would have full subscribers 
maybe aristotle s wife just had a f d up mouth  much less teeth 
3 42 i have been laughing at this for the past 30 minutes and i do not know why
delete your channel mrbeast   
this is quite the philosophical discussion  felix   maybe next time you should talk about what suffering was needed to get to the present day    anyway liked the video tbf   do not think anyone else on youtube could have made philosophy sound as interesting 
right after this video i went to twitter and instagram  i have given in to my desiers i am happy without happy wpic tittys
yes  i love book review  it s really cool to see what you are learning about and how it s mad your life better  these books are about to get read so hard  thanks for inspiring a love of reading in me and so many others felix 
what a great video  
your the highest youtuber becouse mr beast has karl who is a youtuber so mr beast is 2 youtubers
love to find these goldmines hidden in non related titles lol
 dying is part of nature  you crybaby     felix
bring back monthly book club
to be fair  mr beast does give away way more stuff 
so  mr beast diss track soon  lol
do not worry pewdiepie we all sub to you in all of in heart
t rk e altyaz  yapmazsan ge er tabiki best mr beast    ngilizcem bu kadar 
yes i said that dued you need more subs that is s sad
subs to youtube because youtube official account needs subscriber lol
just wait untill mr beast sees this video s intro haha
wut 
donate your account to me
i have declared 
tbf mrbeast has a team  and throws money at people  and he ends almost every video with  a random subscriber gets money  ngl i want money  so i subscribed to mrbeast for the super tiny tiny chance to get some  p lol
i never noticed the giant mole before 
i honestly do not care about the sub count  it is all about the content  the last time i did wanted him to win in sub count was with t series now that i think about it   p d  man the music is just getting better on the videos i swear  the other guy who also have great music is lgr 
mr beast watching this video of pewdiepie  damn he took my thunder away 
maybe aristotles wife had less teeth
pewdiepie has achieved that status where  eventhough mrbeast surpassed him it still feels like pewdiepie is the king of youtube and felix does not need to prove himself anymore  goat status
indeed
inhaling insane amount of copium every king has to step down at some point and pewdiepie time came
 benedictnwoguji7005 mrbeast sucks
mr  beast became an organization  so its not the same for me 
 nakikinuodlang9682 becoming an organization is not always a bad thing  mrbeast s priority is obviously helping the planet and to be of service to people in need  if he wants to achieve that goal he obviously needs an organization and a team behind him to support him 
 wonderland4515 i am not saying that it is a bad thing though
legend status
 wonderland4515 mr beast s priority was always about being successful on youtube and getting a bunch of views and subscribers  appearing like all you want to do is help gets you a lot of that 
my new religion  pewdiepie
yess i had missed the book reviews  great video as always pewds
monthly book subscription from pewds sounds great
damn i love book reviews by felix  it s such a good thing
read quran please  there is so much wisdom and knowledge in it and i am sure you will love to read it 
this is such an interesting style of video where it s life lessons with comedy  and digestible 
make more pewds animated  
you will always be the number 1 for as felix  the true king of youtube 
absolute banger  i would really like for him to discuss about filosophy more  i do not watch a lot of his videos  but this was pleasant experience  thank you 
with mr beast passing you in subs  it is truly the end of an era 
you can rest now my king
big bran gud tanks pewds
can these boring comments stop they are so generic  actual thing on the video  videos like these make me really interested in philosophy but it s kind of hard to get the books
everyone knows felix is still number one even though he got passed by mrbeast  you re awesome felix 
well not to be rude pewdiepie his videos are better then yours no offense
best content  felix discussing what he wants  creating what he wants 
pewdiepie is going to write a distrack on mrbeast soon i can feel it
jag  lskar hur felix gick fr n att spela fnaf och skrika som en idiot till att ha book talk 
play  choo choo charles
plz read j campbell and talk about max laughlin    iloveu you
is it just me or is felix getting handsomer and handsomer in every video  gah dahmn 
make a mrbeast diss track 
i think mrbeast should delete his channel  as a way to tell us he is stoic like our brother pewdiepie
book review 
we watch felix on his quest to nirvana in this video    thanks felix no joke this was very informative
donate to thankmas bozo
in parallel univers    pewds adds mrbeast in the video yo bring view not other wise
 this is philosophically why i am not jealous  meanwhile through the whole video  does nothing the whole time but try to mask his insecurities lol
bro wtf i just woke up to this shit
happy wheels 200
really speaks volumes when it s just mostly been one guy  compared to a cast  or a literal company  truly remarkable how far he s come
ratio
yep
nice
just one guy with a bad webcam for many many years  respect 
you all forgetting how mrbeast helped him in the pewds vs t series war xd  mrbeast is now the new king of yt
no he is not  no one s the  king  lol who cares 
  great wife   an editor
 illogical y mr beast put a couple billboards up and was at like 30 million subs  pewds was at like 80 so no mr beast is not the king
 bruh bruh hmph weakling
for us pewdiepie is still on top
it happens when you stop being as active on your channel because you want to semi retire lol
i could care less about mr beast never liked him at all and cannot stand his honey ad  besides he has a big crew working with him and throws money around like its nothing its not surprising hes gotten so big  not to mention how much he spends just to make a video now is crazy you grew to this size just making videos from your desk and did not spend millions while doing it  your legit mr beast bought his subs you did not
read the quran  quran will help you understand many things
i always forget felix struggled with substance abuse  such an inspiration  happy sobriety 
mr beast s content makes me cringe  yours is nice
lol he cares so much  pewds was never good at lying lol there is a difference between knowing it was going to happen and caring lol he knew mr beast was eventually going to take over  does not mean he has to like it haha
can you still do happy wheels part 200 
please more philosophy review
thank you for the decade of entertainment  you were a big inspiration for me  and i wish you the best in your future to come   brofist
still the first to reach 100m subs 
long live the king
read quran as well 
i am currently in the hospital and just started a book on buddhism  thanks for the great content  felix   
book review  subscribed
cannot believe this video is finally here  i waited for this one for so long
bible when 
i have not watched a mr  beast video in years most people are materialistic and radical as hell  content  right up most people s alley   but not mine
give me happy wheels 
                  s  happens when you got older  and older  an once older people said that    
i have declared
you will always be the most subbed youtuber to me my friend even though you do not care  and mr beast is super good with his content 
read cannot hurt me from david goggins  its not some self help book written by a guy who sits on his ass thinking what words will inspire the most people  its written by a man who is uncommon amongst uncommon men  i left reading the book with a new motto   there is no finish line  i really think you would enjoy it 
in other news  i just found amnesia on game pass  time to relive some memories 
the era of a new king has come mrbeast
we still love you  
never heard of all of them except the last one  got to chance to borrow it from the local library  was blown away from all these philosophical quotes and the artstyle was really speaking to me   it actually changed my life  got promoted  my dog resurrected from the dead and my wife doesn t want a divorce anymore  
felix  if you are looking for another existential fuckery book have a gander at  disappearance of the universe  by gary renard  it blew my mind  everything changes yet stays the same when we become aware of such things  if you are able to digest that one  inside it points to another book which takes you further down the rabbit hole per se   cheers  <3
i am suffering  i want to see piediepie film him self getting his zits cyst ingrownhair on his face removed  popaholics unite 
i love epictetus s discourses and selected writings  thank you for the great read  keep up the philosophical life style 
i do not want to tell felix what to do  but book reviews are pretty fun  and educational 
this came at a really good time for me
i never seen a single video from mr beast and i never even heard about him  how s that possible   
mrbeast has become a brand where felix is still a regular youtuber  to the real ones pewdiepie is still the most subscriber youtube 
if it makes you feel better i am not a mr beast sub
book review is great  you should read bronze age mindset
not to worry  you are still the greatest youtuber of all time      
who remembers when mrbeast used to worship pewdiepie
distrack when
if mr beast does indeed delete his youtube channel  immense respect to him  
do not be a b tch  we want the dis track  jj  still achieved alot and an awesome dude
fun fact  the chances of being born is one in 400 trillions
should have done happy wheels
bro fist  
please consider reading ayn rand  she is another philosopher that is pretty underrated
check the holy quran man
felix is still number one in the category of  independent youtubers 
just get a fortnite skin and you will pass mr beast again lol
dear felix  i think you got a cyst ingrown hair on your upperlip   left side of your chin  go to a dermatologist or let marzia prick sqeeuze it 
first time deciding to watch a book review vid  but honestly was extremely pleasantly suprised by how much of a fun watch it was 
kelly clarkson   nietzsche
aristotle talking about woman having fewer teeth than men was not that just a metaphorical thing  it sounds so much as it was a metaphorical thing and people are just dumb and think he was talking seriously  like wtf 
this is such a classic felix  s video  the humour is also classic pewdiepie     
you did  it way before he did  
mr  beast you have 22 hours left donaldson
you should read and review billy summers  i am a huge stephen king fan and have been reading a lot of his books over the last year 
boook review let us gooooooooooo
for all that you have survived  felix  i jive with your content more  you are just a funny man with a camera  and some editors and marzia  mr  beast has a production staff worthy of a small tv studio  your content is more on just chilling  mr  beast is on spending ludicrous amounts of money  and nothing against him  but again  i feel that your content speaks to a lot of us 
felix s eyes are blue as fuck goddamn
if mr  beast overtaking him in subscribers is what is going to have pewdiepie bring book review back  then i am all for it 
yes
mr  beast has become an organization  so no for me it does not count 
 nakikinuodlang9682 do you know what an organization is
 imdoominic5715i m dead bro called mr beasts and organization    
 juliangrnborg3710and  ishowspeed doesn t edit his videos  does that make him an organization  and i m 100  sure this guy doesn t as well  
 juliangrnborg3710 nope he s an organization that s your logic not mines 
the fact of this video shows us just how much pewds picked up from these books
it is odd how i miss felix after not seeing his videos for a week or more  i really found a big part of myself with this guy 
doing bad choices is flourishment sometimes 
honestly  pewdiepie should start having lectures about philosophy and the aesthetic related subjects  i think i would learn much more than whatever bs my actual teachers are going on about at uni hahahahh
mrbeast had a whole sub2pewdiepie campaign  which is actually one of the 48 laws of power  never outshine the master  by increasing pewds subs he also increased his own  until the day he could surpass his master
i was hoping for a diss track for mr  beast  like he did with t series and cocomelon  but with mr  beast on the diss track  like a collaboration as obviously they have no beef 
1 22  wewe dielive 
i was reading nicomachean ethics too for my college class  and i don t necessarily think i agree with how he defined happiness when you really dive deep into it  he brings up this fact of happiness derived from  human function   which i interpreted for the fact that we should stick to what we re doing and stick to doing it for the betterment of ourselves and society  i think it limits us too much to doing one thing for the rest of my life  later on in the book  i may agree with it more for the fact in book 10 he comes to this conclusion happiness comes from a life of intellect  aristotle is pretty inconsistent through the whole book   but overall i still don t think i agree with him 
i m unsubbing from mr  beast right now
to reach happiness one must stop going in to twitter  pewdiepie 12 12 22
so happy you are doing book review 
the books were good and all  mr  felix  but what we really want to know is your favorite romance books
banana
what about reading the qur an 
not that you care felix  i know you re here for fun now and on your own terms  also  you called this happening  we all saw it coming with the content he does  give give give
hey have you read the princapia it s amazing long read and very mathematical but amazing nonetheless absolutely loved it definitely recommend
good old pewdiepie
the more we know  the deeper the new questions become  i see it as a win win
mr beast s flashy videos will never overtake your genuine content  pewds  you will stay as the king of youtube for its entire history  i have spoken 
you re right  f mrbeast 
why put down mrbeast to uplift pewds  honestly  mrbeast has probably done more in such a short amount of time  but he helps people for a job basically  he is a man of constant charity  and its not like pewds did not used to be flashy and in your face when he was in his peak of relevancy  they are both great creators and are friends  let us respect the changing of the guard 
 jerrysmith2354 people are allowed to have opinions my guy  plenty of people don t enjoy mr  beast s videos
 peterparker1724 the reasoning kind of makes no sense
we waiting for a disstrack mr pewds
sad this dude did not find these books years ago when he was a clown 
for anyone interested in philosophy or psychology or the topics discussed  what fields of work are there that apply  are these  useless  degrees  looking for opinions
i agree with books putting you in a  time  always seems to be the thing i appreciate most after a book is over is the knowledge of the feel of a place and time
idc about books
we need happy wheels part 200 
love these book reviews  i want more pewdiepie philosophy break down vids 
i am also working on youtube but how do you guys grow subscribers like this  does youtube support you 
he became the very thing he swore to destroy
you do not know that i am growing up and learning along with from you   thank you so much for being such a brother and friend to me  
funny  i have that exact book and started reading it earlier this year
 the time is now  old man 
i need he is going to surpass because youtube promotes mr best a lot so he can be the one like pew have some controversy  haven the number one with controversies about bad look for the company
you know  mr beast could do it but eh he will probably do fine in other platforms 
felix kjelberg should read the quran instead of these boring books that are dog shit
the one thing i could do was immediately unsubscribe mr  beast 
i wonder why the title is slightly different
pewdiepie should read the quran next  i remember he wanted to but not sure if he ended up reading it
bring pewdiepie translations you will be watched every international
love you papa pewds  
pewds do not retire from youtube  stay with us until you die or until sven dies  whichever comes first
i am still waiting for happy wheels
it is time foe bitch lasagna 2
more relevant than ever  thank you for letting us be apart of your journey  pewdiepie  was like father to    111m of us
jojo ocean stone  felix  review it 
pewdiepie is love  pewdiepie is life
felix you were the best of our generation  
love you forever
mr beast or for anyone corporate can get n no of subs they want  but pewdiepie is in a league of his own and no soul can match that  period 
i kind of forgot you existed after t series
pewds is a family man now got to respect that 
felix will always be the best youtuber no matter who pass him
fell off
aristoteles wife was a little bit of a bitch hence less teeth
 
i was high key hoping for a friendly pewdiepie vs mr beast diss track battle lmao
                             
i m waiting for when mrbeast comes over to japan for you to give him the crown like smosh did 
its better to give than to receive  that s why mr beast is the best 
ok  i get it now   i cannot take legs from pewdiepie 
i unsubscribed  and then resubbed to help
i want more book reviews
yesss book review is back    
i love your books review  it is great to see you talk about the books that inspire you and helped you develop yourself  it is so rare to see a big creator like you share their love for books thei ve read you are such a great example   seeing you always do your best to improve yourself and seeing how grateful and humble you are towards life  i know i do not know you on a personal level but i cannot help but perceive you like a very good friend  one i have seen change  grow and work very hard to be the best version of himself  i see a good friend who cares for others and it is willing to share to both his struggles and the ways he overcame them sorry if my english sucks but i just wanted to say  thank you for who you are and for inspiring so many people into developing themselves
it does not matter how many youtubers  solo  have more than 100m out there   
bro don t get mad okay  it s just a honest comment the problem is you stay at home like you don t do nothing  you never help people who subscribe you or helping you to go up mr beast helping a lot of people subscriber or not subscriber that s why  bro you need to help those people who need help small or big it s fine 
  oldass greek boomers saying the obvious   phylosppi 
great work  i found a youtuber starwars16 is inspired to be like you  he is a small youtuber and would like your help 
i love epictetus
thank you pewdiepie    bang bang  
i am going to be top    world   youtubers    
please do not became a buddist 
he has 118 now  wow it is crazy
uh wut
thank you felix  i declare 
you know felix read a book when he does not make a diss track on a channel that passes him in subs
mr beast is a machine  your channel is better
love your book reviews x3 i still have your book
felix bro try quran  religious text will have a totally different meaning after that 
2000 years ago its not that long  if you think about it its just 20 people living 100 years  i know  big brain
felix and pewdiepie need to collab fr fr
finally a book review  i m glad i clicked on this video
bring back happy wheels and you ll have it
i loved this thank you  also congrats mr  beast 
make a distrack 
what is the second book called  
i m just here
did not mr beast say he would delete his channel after surpassing pewds in subs  well well well
shame there was no diss track lol
hes also getting a skin in fortnite
do not forget what felix did for us  he said the n word with a hard rrr  i am thankful for that felix  i feel like a proud dad
pewdiepie is michael jordan  mr  beast is lebron 
wewe dielive  felix kelbigilo
ffffff that delayed  i have declared  got me 
dude i remember the days when he worshiped you 
disstrack coming 
super glad to see another video from pewds <3
to be fair  felix stopped trying and started sucking out loud  just make the feckin minecraft videos everyday already 
pewds  if you liked aristotle then you ll love plato s the republic  highly recommended  also you should read the 4 texts on socrates as a prerequisite  and alcibiades 1 is good too 
to be fair  mrbeast   jimmy s channel is basically a corporation at this point  unlike felix s and so still the most subscribed independent creator copium
would anyone else here appreciate a pewdipie special of dr  pimpel popper with dr  lee and pewdipie   d
this is just like chainsaw man fr  it is me guys
time and space are as infinite as the surface of a basketball 
bro helped me
pewdiepie part of the android gang 
pewdiepie playing happy wheels   i sleep  felix last name talking about philosophy   real shit 
i expected a diss track   disappointed 
epic book review
favourite series on youtube
book review was long overdue  thanks felix   
no there is 3 you born  and you die  in between is live
how lucky we are to have this man
i missed book review 
pewdiepie is the epitome of entertainment in youtube entertainment like a old powerful hero that retired because time has come for him to pass the torch to the new generation to rekindle the flame   you have nothin to prove anymore because you already have the title itself of king of youtube entertainment  many may surpass you but never your legacy 
book review
my guy clickbaited  
petition to bring back happy weels  
still  1 youtuber in my book  get it  no    it ain t a joke  i m serious 
can you make a video about books recommendation for beginners  i really like reading light novel like harry potter or percy jackson  but i never try reading another books about some complicated stuff  also knowing i do not really good in english either
wise words
still the king 
mrbeast have a big team behind him but pew have allways done it alone that is why he allways will be the king of youtube remember that
long live the king
this video let me question my own excistenz
is normal bro mr beast gives so much money away people like to see that   
i would love to hear your takes on pragmatism  phenomenology and enactivism  love the philosophy
happiness is something for me that i want when i do not know what i want  eliminativism makes perfect sense to me and folk psychology is borderline misinformed   also wait till you get to metaphysics   it gets really weird 
i remember watching felix when i was 8 years old with my brother and no matter how many subs he s had  i ve always found my way back here for almost 13 years  you will always be the king of youtube  it take s a lot to keep people coming back for years on end 
you are goat
the sun is a giant ball of a gas  you need to know more 
still best youtuber
pewds teeth so wired
i just wanted to tell you that jesus loves you  he died for you  so that you can be saved  all you have to do is believe in him and turn to him  he will literally always be right next you  even during the toughest of times  god will never turn away from you <333
<3
never expected a trash like mr beast will surpass this legend
thanks for sharing your wisdom king  
i hope pews passes mr wet the sheets  pews has and always will be the king of youtube
i was expecting something completely different and less nice given the title  i was clickbaited satisfactorily   d
distract when 
pewds your litterally jordan and mr b is literally lebron   you ll always be the goat   coreyken is kobe     i could make a starting line up of all they goats  
pewds read quran its the best book in the word
is that the dandruf on you are shoulder or the design pewds
he has chocolate   and you have pugs  seems pretty even to me
more book reviews
of course he did with this garbage content the you have been putting out
please make next video happy wheels  ty
quick unsub from mrbeast 
we need more philosophical and space talks with pewds 
book review  let us go 
would you ever consider reading the new testament of bible  would like your thoughts on it 
mr beast is youtube s golden boy  they are pushing his videos like crazy to every demographic  he is like an elevated kids  channel  you have more depth and personality  if everybody has a choice they will choose you for sure 
pewds how tall are you  i m thinking about buying one of your chairs because the last gaming chair i got was a little short for me
he is 5 10
rare to see a case of clickbait in which the content of the video was even better than what the thumbnail and title made it look like 
lol  i totally got one of his sponsored segment vibes when he started talking about suffering and craving    p
this is actually historic i cannot believe mrbeast has more subscribers than you now but he deserves it so good for him
it is funny how he just does not care
joy supercedes happiness  this is why the joy of felix being liberated from caring about sub counts supercedes the happiness he feels for jimmy  mr beast  passing him in subscribers 
the student has become the teacher
felix we cannot take your legs kind sir  because you clearly have no legs  that is scientifically proven 
well if craving is suffering i need money  cash app   skonkass
now you have a lot of subs  but the views  they are not looking that good
i really hope pewdiepie will one day read and understand holy quran  he will get all of those things he talked  about in this video their eternal meaning in holy quran 
pewds   take my arms take my legs do not take my legs me   you don t have legs 
japan wack
watching this video 2 hours after upload and mr beast already gotten 3 m subs more than in the video
mrbeast a few years ago   we will not surpass pewdiepie in subs because that would be treason  man did not keep his promise
bitch lasagna part 2
i do not know how but this book is in my highschool  it just appeared in a library week ago  i think writer of this book will be unknown for ever 
i have been waiting for a book review  thanks felix 
you should read the holy quran it answers so many questions and it tells the truth
you will always be the king of youtube
brofist  
happy wheels part 200  the fucking memories <3
mr beast is king
omfg i cannot believe our king as been dethroned by the royal beast knight
i did not expect book review   let us goooo
i just like felix  and japan
let us goooo book review
but maybe aristotels  wife was missing some teeth
mr beast passed me sub   also pewds anyway do you heared about buddhism book
pls make more of these scientifical videos 
what  still  you have not read  the revolutionary phenotype  the amazing story of how life begins and how it ends  it is been 4 years 
 do not live forever bad    buddhism
i was waiting for more books
   
  
i thought it was a coffeezilla video
i love how the topics of said book is an allegory of pewdiepie s reaction to being surpassed by mr beast  remain stoic and try and desire the right things
   
if audible doesn t reach out for you to read these books they ve done something wrong 
this is literally what i want right now   popular youtubers reviewing books   spreading knowledge   giving life lessons and all  the internet has cheered me up today
hmmmmmm
haha your channel costs alot less then a channel like mr beast thanks for your own eulogy
 meanwhile markiplier has registered an onlyfans account and casually broke the website  my  my  my precious bois  you all growing up so fast  a proud sob 
mr beast just pays people to subscribe him 
hey what app do you use for books
fun fact  i have not subscribed to pewdiepie yet
you really got to read the nt
you will always be the king of youtube  new generation new league but you always be the one everyone going to remember you  reminds me of car 3 movie
ngl epictetus got me good xd
allah please give felix hidayah to islam
our mathematical universe by max teg is soo cool hehehehe i was also obsession for some time

i usually do not watch all of the book rewievs but this one be ss l  l  lapin  good job fel x  keep up keepin  me up  <3
felix you should read book named quran  this book is mind blowing
mrbeast figlio delle guardie
i hope that he does the pewdiepie collaboration some day
happy wheels part 200  let us go 
even if the content has changed i still enjoy watching you
mr beaat offers his subscribers islands  jets  cars  so people sub to him for that purely  you offer straight up entertainment 
felix  how do you read  posture wise  i feel like my reading posture sucks and i was wondering if you have some ergonomic way to read 
enchiridion  like adventure time 
read quran  next it ll change your life
i have yet to watch a mr beast video  i have watched so many videos about him but never one of his videos  it is strange 
the pimple

i was not expecting a book review  
i came here for the drama  i stayed for the buddidism
book review let us goooo
we die we live and in between we watch pewdiepie all day what is this  pewdiesm  
i really hope  book review  was not your passing of the torch video for mrbeast  when smosh did it for you it was really fun  be kind of crappy if all you did was talk about buddhism and how it helped you to not care about anything because you are another rich white guy who needed to block out the haters

i don t know why but i have a feeling that with this video you have opened my mind in a certain way  i do not know i feel better after this video  keep it up  
wdym bro he has 118m and he had 111m like a month ago wtf no hate i am just confused
videos like these are the ones that make me proud to be a bro  everyone assumes this channel is all jokes and silly but we ve also got really cool stuff like this   thanks pewds for giving us this type of content 
man i love book reviews from pewdiepie
felix if you have not read the quran you have not read nothing   i know i sound like i am pushing it but please do not judge until you try  
yes please pick up the catechism of the catholic church as well
the way you grew in everything  being there our entire childhood is something i will always keep with me 
ill relate more to felix and not mr beast unfortunately or fortunately  basically grow along with felix along the way from scrawny  edgy to  zen felix  
sorry pewds but i disagree with the idea of those philosopher
hmm yes  your pfp makes sense
your point is  imagine having no arguments and attacking with someone is pfp
 sinbadnotbad dogwater pfp you cannot blame them
sorry pewds not going to have my 11 year old watch the same guy that made me laugh for 8 years  funny yes naughty also yes no hard feelings your still rich and beautiful
really appreciate all the content and entertainment over the years  thanks so much  
man you re amazing really  thank you for your book review   
more book reviews
he dies
are we not going to talk about how in less than a day mr beast gained another 3 million subs
no other way to celebrate the bow out  respectable position  declared by a respectable ally 
i woke up into an existential crisis today and this video single handedly brought me back into my body and i would like to thank you for that felix  you did more than you thought with this one  
tweet tweet  like a bird
 
 lora beolab yes that s my last name
bruh it is high time you read the quran
pewdiepie will always be the og biggest youtuber  just the name pewdiepie will be be remembered for a long time
all the principals discussed by you pewds are basics in islam  it is the way of life that prophet mohammad   peace be upon   him taught us  i am not saying maybe i am saying you will learn interesting things from islam and our book is called quran  your loyal 13 yo army soldier
remember felix  your achived 111m subs by yourself  mr beast needed a whole team
that s true 
finally t series wins 
you are like 3 4 years late
 araz1204 maybe he is using explorer  
t series has won for like 4 years now goofy also its a company channel
obvio q jimmy te va a pasar en subs si ni subt tulos en espa old para tus v deos pones xd
come on guys let us get him back on track  
i might ve unsubscribed from mrbeast    oof
you should also read the quran
 what is that  no longer  1 in subs  i no longer care 
chad pewdiepie get s passed by mr beast and makes a video that he knows will get terrible retention and views because popularity means nothing to a man who has read the classics
if you want a book that changes the way you think please do a video on the 48 laws of power i think it is absolutely a life changing book because it changes the way you see things and the way you think you can identify someone and hwat there about just from looks movement and the actions their doing learned from this book there is also the art of seduction robert green is the author
i just had a psychology called  the self  it was very interesting but hard  i recommended  today was my final for that class 
book review 
happy weels
i was waiting for this hahahahah 
you can tell he is deeply hurting and salty inside  its great  this overrated and lame tuber is no longer top dog  i never understood how he was so popular anyway  literally has no outstanding qualities which other  very smaller tubers have  long may the decline continue 
yikes i do not like the guy that much but to wish for his downfall  that is just not cool
actually he does not seem to give 2 shits  
 thefinestzygarde not necessarily  more so  i wish for other more talented youtubers to surpass him 
 peeturpain9379 yes but that is not exactly what you said  a better way would be to say   smaller youtubers that have not had the time to shine will finally get a shot to shine  pewdiepie losing subs is a good thing for smaller youtubers  i do not know  just nicer ways to put it  
great video as always  i missed book reviews and i certainly needed this one
he should still do happy wheels
still the king  
omg  i have waited so long for another one of these
give back my subscribers  you theif 
1  in the buddha s words   bhikkhu bodhi 2  the nicomechean ethics   aristotle 3  enchiridion   epictetus 4  the gay science   friedrich nietzshe 5  our mathematical universe   max tegmark 6  this book loves you   pewdiepie
i can t say enough about how much i loved this video  the books  the edits  the mrbeast shoutout and you just make us laugh  my favorite book is the last one you mentioned    pewdiepie 
you have given us billions of laughs  thank you for everything pewds 
is he ded now 
your saying it like he just made a goodbye video
it is almost like he is still posting   
 bruhbruh6408 bro you were never on
yea but what is a billion laughs vs a million dollars per video lol
id take money over a chuckle any day
 jeremy the unfallible   n a      you will never be content
 velvetaeon2774 nor wiii those who are disappointed in pewds being surpassed  i am oniy but making an obscure point
bro just like beating pele s record is not being better then pele is same as mrbeast getting ahead of you   you ll always be on top for me cuz you created an empire alone 
 do not live forever bad   pewdiepie 2022
gosh i hate books 
omg yesss i love his book reviews     
wow  i thought he was joking  
did you visit sweden hills in japan  if not  a video would be cool 
so when is the mr  beast diss track ft mr beast 
pews is retired so it does not matter  the sub count i mean   
even though hes retired  he still has the 2nd highest non company sub count  crazy 
7 09 dying is not bad  but humans have come to control it quite a bit  it is like you are saying do not take medicine because dying is not bad  stoicism was invented long ago and does not always apply now  at least the dying part 
ww2 era british grandmothers were the epitome of stoicism  granny chad
felix talking about stopping bad habits  agreeing with him  and knowing damn well i have been on youtube for around 3 hours straight 
 having fewer teeth   means something like    being less able to have an impact    it is an ancient greek idiom  like   he kicked the bucket  is  he died 
happy wheels 
i really do love when felix educates us about philosophy  stuff is so important and should be studied by everyone  
noooooo
long live king pewdiepie  
thank you kelly clarkson 
bring back ring back lwiay 
these books sound so interesting
24 hours later   mrbeast channel is gone
4 10 felix understands that this is not happiness  therefore he is a true king to me
this changed me
please do more
yesss self control  many and all should could learn how to take happiness into their own hands  plz pewdiepie shout out other channels that say this stuff well
i recommend einzelganger
19yo army rally  we could maybe pass mr  beast s subs  at least temporarily 
love how felix did not even bother with the title anymore 
holy crap i got clicked bait into getting lectured hahah
i have never watched a mr beast video in my life
it is all right  it is all good  pewds have done it all and we are all just chilling with him now 
most of your subs are fakes made during the t series thing anyway
mrbeast is a team vs one man
hoping that now he is passed your sub count youtube will finally stop showing me adverts trying to bribe me to sub to his channel 
you can really get a sense of where you are in life  when you can sit around and read about philosophy  that is not a diss   remember stoicism  but more just a general observation that if you have peace of mind in order that you can sit and read and digest philosophy  then you are already half way there 
you really should have done happy wheels part 200
i do not believe he is actually read even half of half of these books
pleaaaaase beast does not stand a chance vs such wisdom  
you knew this day would come but your still on top of this youtube world
i do not read books but hearing pewds talking about it is just so nice  kind of makes me want to read it but i also know i would not actually read it even if i get the book xd
best series you have
happy wheels  love book review
at least pewdiepie has more sense than money  unlike mr beast
it is my fault pewds   i subscribed to mr beast  i am sorry for betraying you  but his public challenges are so interesting  they are like amazing race and survivor
even as a joke  i am now concerned mr beast is  just crazy enough to delete one of his channels
mrbeast is better
f in the chat 
irrelevant channel now  not even 3rd biggest on the platform
pewdiepie will always live in our hearts as the best youtuber of all time
you have worked hard for what you have got  we appreciate you  mr beasts videos are fake anyways
i really liked this video thnx felix
play inr streams to stop mrbeast 
happy for both felix and jimmy for all of their success  they made so many days better for people all over the world and that is worth more than money and subscribers  thank you 
the bridge incident
 codebrown2273 what a fucking n
 codebrown2273 one of the saddest days in gamer history
11 56 imagine mr beast actually doing it tomorrow  omg i am scared now 
i love pew
i am subbed to both but i always get recommended to your channel   still a king in my algorithm
i love felix s book reviews      king of youtube for me forever  
hedonists vs stoicisrs
pewds will remain and always have the title of the most consistent content creator to ever exist on a social media platform  period
omg w book review
yea but mr  b gives away boat loads of money 
read the quran
jimmy and felix should do an epic rap battles colaboration for this
we need more content like this more often felix pleaseeee book review or philosophy in general  i love it personally
i have watched you for over 9 years and it is like you were the friend that introduced you to youtube english terms funny terms swearing and games making me laugh cry  eventually you are one of those people that cross my mind everyday almost like a distant family member  these other youtubers like mr beast will never create that deep connection with their viewers they are a production channel keep producing make money put money back in the production  very shallow
can someone tell me if mr beast replies
these high quality  high iq pewds sh tposts are why i kept watching all these years
pewds does not need lots of money to entertain us  just himself 
felix is doing the same thing again and again and again  i enjoy steak but i cannot eat steak everyday 
mr beast is a bad person on a real
you should have done happy wheels part 200
would be nice to hear fraction of these things in school  instead all i heard was  so aristoteles lived long time ago and was a great philosopher  anyway  here is a text you have no context for  analyse it  and then we wonder why people are pretty much almost always emotionally underdeveloped 
i actually read our mathematical universe after you recommended it last time  it was a very difficult read  it felt like homework  it has great reviews on goodreads so i imagine that if you already have an understanding of physics  it is a very interesting book  but i did not find it as easy and interesting as you explain in this review  and in the previous one where you mentioned it 
here is my second and 3rd accounts 4u felix 
wen kybalion review 
i think you might like mans search for meaning by victor frankl
so excited to have another book review 
pewdiepie  take my legs me  cannot take what is not there 
i hope you back to play games   
go off felix 
felix  you gave me a heart attack  i read mr beast passed and thought the man died 
felix you should read about absurdism philosophy  i think you would like it
i love book reviews
book revieeew  yay 
that is the 2020 beresford edition of aristotle s n  ethics  it is a translation into american vernacular   much less dense then other translations and with fun name calling like  dour locals 
book review 
23 hours and counting  the counter assault is coming
i have declared you will always be a legend  
got to love the   s   ubs   in the title
i love the irony behind making a video about true happiness and stoicism to celebrate being surpassed by a channel that promotes mainly easy money  capitalism  destruction of goods and lack of real quality content  no hate on mr beast  he seems a cool dude  but i kind of cringe at his channel and all that it represent 
now you are talking about some important stuff  pewds  good stuff
diss track diss track diss track
still the most ad revenue per persons employed 
b lasagna is keeping you alive
you will always be  1
if you continue make videos about playing games  you will gain more subs  not out of the game topic that make people bored   
i love these kind of vids pls do not change
you should try inner engineering by sadhguru  it is a really good book about spirituality which makes so much sense 
pewdiepie why have not you made a new channel yet
book review  let us go
i wonder if mrbeast could collaborate with youtube dev team and actually  delete  his channel for a day lol
am i weird for barely knowing who mr  beast is and having never once seen one of his videos 
 do not sleep on epictitties 
he passed you because you are lazy asf  and yes because you do not care yet you still monitize your vids greedy ef  freeloader  prove you really do not care  stop monitizing your vids
you will forever be the king  you did not need to hire all these people to help you drop something big on to something small big or 1 billion orbeez  felix you really are one of my biggest inspiration  i do not want to kiss ya butt but   you will forever be our youtube king   
we demand happy wheels part 200 
honestly  i guarantee almost every youtuber hopes to someday spend their twilight years on youtube the way felix is  he s still hilarious  captivating  and thoughtful he wants to help people grow while not denying himself the same opportunity to grow and live his life  i mean the dude still has some of his best years ahead  he made it  i mean most of the youtubers i ve followed over the years either fell into obscurity  got cancelled  or got so sick of the spotlight they had to quit  keep doing you felix  loved the book review 
you are hilarious
you are starting to sound as chinese speak english lol
you walked so the generation could run
wewe dielive  that s my new mantra
felix will always be the king
thank god  a book review  i have been waiting for so long time to get out of reading slump
my boy needs jesus
i got so scared when i read mr beast  passed 
your subscriber base today is probably in now their upper twenties where mr  beast  are all jr  high age
not really a shock
lowkey it is kind of a crime that mr beast passed him
regardless of sub count you are still my number 1
epictetus
pewdiepie  aristotle me  i literally have a philosophy exam tomorrow at 8 am
honestly been thinking about unsubbing   he s retired the contents changed and he doesn t care about being public online  untill he runs out of money running low  that s how it always is 
nah he is set honestly if you want to go for it but i will still stick for any content in general
pewd s philosophy  anyways thank you 
i love you so much
book review returning is what i needed in life
you need to read the book of ecclesiastes it will help you understand the meaning of life 
you re the best  always  no matter the number
read quran just try it once
no the bible
 ashleyr6809 compare them you will find out which one is the right one and which one makes the most sense
is craving considered you craving to workout  like if it is good craves what does it say for that
bad cravings
book reviews are always the best videos  
maybe another disstrack 
pewdiepie help me get home to my family for christmas
no
lost his 1st place and then talks about scripture  what a chad
others would be different
happy wheels part 200 we need it
jesus is king
<3
cannot wait to read and educate myself on  buddishism   aritotle  and  philosophah 
king
man rip
i am unfollowing you  so i can follow mr  beast
bye
bye
bye
bye
we will always love you no matter your subs  
we should have gone to happy wheels part 200
i will be back for happy wheels 200 
stream ragnarok
mr beast is trying to dethrone t series and give pewdiepie his crown back 
woo 
mr beast passed him and he turned into pewdiepie the philosopher  he is entered his final form
mrbeast may be the   but he still knows who is king   
live  die  watch pewdiepie
mrbeast   makes an irl willy wonka chocolate factory with gordon ramsy in it pewdie   shares a bunch of valuable knowledge about life  how to better live and how to sorta stay sane i do not need the first channel   just like i do not need twitter  d
me beast over pewdie
what once was is not the same anymore   content is changing and felix is the old way  but jimmy is the new  family friendly  way   too bad he is skirting child labor laws 
mr beast needs many people in his video but pewdiepie is solo
should read some dostoevsky
where is the diss track 
fuck i hope jimmy does not do some crazy shit like delete and get 100 million subs in one day
would love to see a felix pewdewpie colab
you are the  1
it is been a while since we had  book review  and hearing pewds theories and thoughts of each book  would not it be interesting if he created a book of stuff he has learned throughout the years
you will be always the king  brofist 
its ok felix you were the first king
mr beast is now a company though
i really like these videos a lot  thank you for uploading another one  i plan on checking some of these books out
mr  beast coming for t series
i came and joined the broarmy i do not even know how long ago  i was here when he got the gold play button and i will be there when he retires  i am so fucking proud of what became of you   hail the king of youtube
it is easier to take in this time around because mrbeast is someone he actually respects from what i can tell
book review equals one million subs
i read a lot of books this year because of you  would love to hear your thoughts on the hermetic philosophical work the kybalion
 mrbeast time is ticking
i appreciate that you are sharing the books you have found interesting  i think i might look a few of them up 
here before mr beast
aristotle socrates etc  do not make me go back to school i have studied them enough   
waiting for a mr  beast diss track
should we bring back the trend sub 2 pewdiepie
wait  this is insightful  more book review 
because he is loved
i miss book review thanks you felix  i haven t read a book in a long time but i been thinking lately to start reading and that because of your reviews hopefully i ll start soon
so someone else mentioned this in the comments earlier  but i love and second the idea of having a pewds monthly news letter     including things like foreign products you have tried and liked or history on new places you have recently visited in japan  or words of the day or whatever books you are currently reading     just an idea but would be really cool    either way it is awesome to witness your new ventures in life and am extremely happy for you and your family  
a quote for the world    if you want to surpass the true  then become the true  
the amount of dry humour in this video is hilarious
i am not a deep thinker like you  but listening to your recommendations always makes me want read them 
first cocomelon  now satan i mean mr beast
why did you correct yourself  you were right the first time
 femurbreaker0 yessir
i haven t watched you in years but as soon as i saw book review in the subtitle preview i started watching
pewdiepie is still the number 1 youtuber because he is always been by himself  he never needed over exaggerated videos to get views  people watched him because they loved him that is why he is still number 1 
well look s like jimmy has 24 hrs left this is going to be good   and proops to felix for bringing back the good old book reviews
bro should read bhagwadgita interpretations
king of youtube is similar to mj s title king of pop  it s not a throw around name  it s something that belongs to someone from their works  forever and always  
i m proud of you  mr beast is probably one of my favorite youtubers  but you still did it first 
we we die live  amazing spiderman 2012
hai coppiato favij con hapy whelz tuti e due vi sitte fermato all episidio 200
the ending of this video was masterful  the editing was pretty spectacular too    cheers to not having the responsibility of number 1 anymore 
these are my favorites
we all knew it was going to happen it was just a matter of time
ok now do happy wheels pt 200
we fucking love you felix 
thanks felix for tricking millions into book review <3
wtf is this video
best clickbait i ever saw
bro does not know what clickbait is
buddha fruit  
hi
book review is always great
thank you felix 
book review     fi nally   
screw mr beast
mr beast has 23 hours to delete his channel 
scholar pewds surpassed barrel now
what an epic ending  will beast do it  the guy is solid almost to a fault  i could really see him deleting it after that 
there is a mistake in the title lol
can you imagine if mrbeast really did delete the 100m sub channel and then re uploaded everything to a brand new channel called mrbeast2 0 or something  i wonder how fast he would beat the record for fastest channel to 100m 
if parallel universes exists  being successful in this one will rob another version of you that success  i will not become a thief 
wewe dielive
diss track please
maybe some of his wife s teeth had fell out 
nahhh am a boomer myself and i really cannot keep up with mr beast s content on his main channel to be honest  i grow old watching this swedish man and still watching him until the day i die xd
felix is still the king of youtube  but still congrats to mrbeast
we love you felix you will always be  1 in our hearts  
hey anna  want to be my waifu 
 alex ox1fq bro it is probably a 40 year old man called steve
 alex ox1fq your father is ashamed of you
 jaaaaaaaaw woah  even better
 jaaaaaaaaw projecting  get a grip  felix has a female fanbase too 
 femurbreaker0 cope harder
my name is jeff
honestly i never payed much attention to felix aka pewdiepie and i have watched probably every beast vid and yet  i agree with this comment  much love for both of them but oddly pewdiepie is just more significant in my eyes i do not know how 
i love that lol
 annaphelan635 am i a 40 year old man named steve   
t series is number one
 psxl tseries cheated with sub bots and wrongfully got him banned in their country over a satirical song
 andrewedmondson5943 t series still getting subs and i stated the fact
 psxl pewdiepie stopped the sub war when he was at 93mil he was ahead at the time  because some random mf said sub to pewdiepie before suicide bombing in a shooting
mrbeast will always be  1 in mine
 tylerasada2908  tseries is number one
 shashank932  this war will never stops until youtube itself name the winner
 psxl yes
 andrewedmondson5943  and its friking awesome that pew die pie himself said they did nothing wrong in his congratulations video 
 shashank932 pew die pie also said that tseries may hit billion subs someday
 tempoaccla4041  ikr people praise those youtubers for absolutely no reason while tseries is a whole team with experience of decades of indian cinematography and alot of people still love tseries
 alex ox1fq  that is a dude with girl account   do not fall for the trap
 1 mr  beast 6000
 alanethomas1002 tseries is number one and i stated the fact
 alex ox1fq  waifu  that is 3d not 2d also this are not dating site
 nevergonnagiveyouup63 sorry i forgot the part that i asked you 
 insert spongebob   he was number 1  but honestly  he really will be  i grew up w him  we all did 
steve and alex holy shit rhe prophecy is true
 annaphelan635 thought it was clear that it was a joke  but okay 
 shilohstout5152   he will be forgotten with time and  it would not happen if he did not lose four million subs
 annaphelan635 nice try steve
 alex ox1fq missing a father  
lol make it sound like he died because he got passed xd
i love my 4 wives dearly
 navmn wtf
 jaaaaaaaaw well do not say anything then girls can watch pewdiepie as well seriously   why do you guys start shit
 annaphelan635 cool do not care
do not make an idol out of any man 
 seanbean3070 very nice beard 
 alex ox1fq unspoken rizz
simp
 billandlizy hi steve 
 younusbaddou78 if i was missing a father i would be a soft homosexual just like you 
 jaaaaaaaaw joe biden 
nope i pinned him down and not regretting that 
no
stoicism is dope to an extent until folks fall into a worship of  natural order  which often just results in substituting bias in for  nature 
10 10 editing
i am bringing out a book within a few months  lmao somehow i hope pewds get to review it
you inspired me to read the first time  when you reviewed  discourses of epictetus  i did not read it completely as i was in a different state of mind back then  but i did read a good chunk and it was very thought provoking  right now i am reading 12 rules of life by jordan peterson  absolutely brilliant book  i hope pewds you read it and review it in the next review 
end of an era
thank you bro 
i do not read books but i would be ok with this channel becoming a book review channel 
take my legs lol you do not have legs
stronger is quite the banger  niche would agree if he was alive today i m sorry if that all i took from the vid 
 best  clickbait  ever 
i am buddhist and i agree with you felix life is suffering as you said and i am happy to see that you understand about life good luck 
but never be forgotten 
it would be popular again if you are doing a great video with popular partner  pewdiepie would quickly give us happiness all of hours
guys let s cancel mrbeast
i need manga review
even though he s a month late basically i won t complain i was waiting for his reaction for a while now
sound tracks are too loud  cannot hear you clearly  
6 50 illuminati confirmed
diss track  beast lasagna
time for bish lasagna 2 
mr beast became the villain  allowing his subs to pass pewd s  shame  shame 
he never wanted to pass pewdiepie  he even said so in an interview
you ll always be the king of youtube no matter what felix  even if you re dead lol
now drop acid pewds trust me 
love this channel but mrbeast s channel is simply more entertaining     
buddhism is real close to stoicism  interesting seeing felix interpret them
the most not boring boring video ever
mr beast is a company of several members who appear in their videos  you are one person  it is admirable what you have achieved on your own 
i have brought this up and is also the reason i do not watch mrbeast because there are too many people for me not to really care much about
you think mrbeast didn t start from scratch  you re really ignorant
i consider him as a brand
now imagine a parrallel universe in which pewdiepie is not the king of youtube scary thoughts  p
23 hours mr beast
what about lwiay felix
you should review the new testament  it was written around the same period as the other philosophers you ve read and it would be interesting to hear your take on philosophies that have had such a significant impact on western culture 
i mean pewds was the king of yt for years and is semi retired  i think it s safe to say that his legacy is truly untouchable  forever the king of the bros  
when you stop posting for a while to purposely letting other creators pass you
s ubs
glad you do not care  felix > pewdiepie
are you subscribed to mr beast     are you  
he probably is
his channel died
yours 
111m subs  aka the second highest non company channel is dead to you  lmaoooooo
who tf is mr beast 
bitch lasagna
felix  its sad to hear that someone has yet again  passed you in  s ubs 
never thought i would sit through a philosophy talk with pewdiepie  solid views my friend
happy wheels part 200 petition 
you will always be the father of youtube pewds
rip mrbeast went from being his biggest supporter during the t series war to becoming the new king of youtube  
are you going to do the pass the crown video that smosh did for you also for mr beast 
yea typical of felix to catfish us into reading books
let s just hope he passes t series 
learn to make a fake professional smile like mr beast pewd    
always  2
mr beast might be the new king of youtube but felix will always be our king <333  d
pewdiepie is youtube  
jimmy s been real quiet since this video dropped 
i thought it was going to lwaiy and i was happily surprised 
never thought pewdiepie would read a book about buddhism but it is interesting to learn about other religions other than your own which can really expand your way of thinking 
i did not even think about it
i do not care  you are the real one for me and for many others  we love you pews  
great picks  i feel like you would love kierkegaard as well 
 s ubs 
probably the best book review so far  a selection of some of the greatest writings 
odds are pewdiepie will outlive us all  statistically speaking by comparing his status to 99  of his audience  even those 15 years younger than him  he will outlive us all 
it is sad you have not read the qur an yet
you need to read the bible
pewd s  i d follow you to the depths of valhalla  in my mind  you are still king of the youtube s 
man you are real king and you cannot be changed
beast campaigned for pew years ago
 i have one singular trick up my sleeve  pulls out a fertilizer bomb
please try quran  
wait  the enchiridion is not just some magic book in adventure time 
funny how he uploaded an hour ago and it shows mrbeast having 115 million subs and now he has 118 million 
i love you bro
who cares if he surpasses you  you are actually funny and original  and you are basically a pinnacle of youtube and history  mr  beast is basically a void teeny bopper magnet 
i love when you make videos about book  philosophy  games  or body building  it is more like yourself and i am also interests in all of the above lol
do happy wheels part 200
noooooo its not true sverige kan inte f rlora
who is mr  beast 
d
i want a huge amazing collab video of you guiding mrbeast through a trial and you handing him the torch telling him to make you proud 
m
the passing of the torch has been given although we will always stay with the principle 
i have declared
i thought you already did collabs with pewdiepie recently
you are the god of youtube forever no matter what
love book review  cannot wait for the next one when ever it will come 
this will undoubtedly be the video that gets felix past mr beast for most subs   i see now why he was strategically saving book review for this situation  well played sir 
the biggest brain
read bhagavad gita it has knowledge of god s  for real  read it and you will understand what i am saying
can you do movie reviews  start with  everything everywhere all at once  it may interest you because it talks about nihilism
these are all great books 
love you pewds
curious as to what mr beast will do about the channel deletion thing now because he actually takes bets seriously  
read marx  
 the gay science  is sus
love these book choices 
remember this is the same guy who used to use breast in larger and used to suck sean s nipple
felix is still a king  he has helped us all grow in some way or another  not to mention this whole time it has just been him  compared to mrbeast who is multiple people  not to take credit from breast  he is great in his own way  in terms of singular youtubers  felix is great 
i doubt you will see this but i have another book recommendation pewds  based somewhat similarly on your last book you mentioned  it is called  the elegant universe  written by the american physicist brian greene which delves into superstring theory and multidimensional universes  it sounds like a complex read  but the way he breaks it down for it to be easily understandable without insulting your intelligence is great  and it is part of a fantastic series of books 
when is mrbeast going to host meme review  
more philosophy content  more fitness content  i want swedish man teach me how to be the perfect man 
book review kept me from subscribing to mr beast    no mr beast craving here 
this video proves why pew is superior    beast has the same name as the devil mark of the beast   and all he ever talks about is money   the love of money is the root of all evil 
please do happy wheels part 200
now do lwiay
we have been blessed with this book review  keep them coming
pewdiepie has malfunctioned you all
yeeeeeees book review let us goooooooooo
mr  beast is okay if you re under 15  i ll admit  he can be mildly entertaining at times but pewds videos have substance and the latest vlog series is the feel good content we all need 
he would have been such a great christian
missed book review so much
he had a good run  but it was always going to happen  there is always a bigger fish 
i hope pewdiepie hits 112m
felix you are youtubes daddy
he has 118m now lol
hey pewdiepie people are saying mean words to you because you suck
diss track when   
buddhism does not offer eternal life  jesus christ died so we can live forever  repent and follow jesus  let him change your life 
buddha is not real but jesus is 
when does felix have time to read all these books
bro try reading the bible and do a review pewds  love you are vids   
its genuinely entertaining and captivating to hear you talk about these things  thanks dude 
merry christmas  jesus loves you felix  
i am sorry  but its really easy for someome like yourself to talk about happiness when your material needs are already met  i would read the room lol
1 23 we we dielive
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ 
give away a jet   crush a lamborghini   get it together you loser  lol
it would be so cool if y all had a crown commissioned like a youtube crown and then made a video were like you passed on the crown to mrbeast as the new king of youtube 
mrbeast is the new youtube king
health is wealth
i think kratos was based from this guy  from chaotic and havoc kind of person to calm and reasonable person
pewds is a king  all kings have their reign  enjoy your life felix 
i do not know if you saw my comment on your q a or if someone else asked this or if you got this idea independently  but i am so hyped for this  also the books you chose are more or less the same books i would have read anyway  so i am really on board 
you will always be the best
let us go pewds time for bitch lasagna2
whut  i thought this happened already months ago 
3 38  caught me off gaurd  
mr beast is doomed if he does not make a book review also   
pewds should do another video like the parallel universe one  genuinely loved that one
this youtube king making boring videos
time for a diss track surely
give us happywheels
number is like peepee  it is how you use it  not how big
the first actual youtuber to pass pewdiepie in subscriber  felix is still the king of youtube 
do not upload anymore  basically retired   hmm  wonder why this channel is dead  
send more book videos plz
well  pewdiepie still the youtuber with the biggest amount of subs  mr  beast is basically a whole team
how about the bible felix 
mr beast disstrack coming soon
not the s ubs 
what about fb  that is the worst habit  wtf  i have heard several people bashing insta and twitter in the past few days  with no mention of fb  which is by far the fk worst  wtf 
come get me zuck
you did it without massive giveaways and events  it was all you
ty sensei master pewd   
mr beast last video  drives a train through a brick wall  jumps a car with a rocket over busses  felix retaliates with a book review  loved this 
see what you caused mr beast  pewdiepie is now philosophizing again  i hope you are proud of what you have done 
rip
hello pewds  i recommend reading the holy bible  there are great stories in there and they are real  all of those thing written in it happened   
can we get a congratulations song for mrbeast 
gurl we just started the video why is he roastibg me
delete your channel mrbeast  do it
we all dielive
such a chill video  made me really relax amd forget about my stressful thoughts
king of youtube forever  
does this mean your retirement is coming
i think it is funny that mt beast said if he ever surpassed pewds he would delete his channel  gues that is just lost in the past now 
when is the next meme review
the guy who retired as king cannot be dethroned  however he is no longer the king 
 
this video is a certified hood classic   i have declared 
if you are a existing human being and you arn t subbed to pewdiepie you deserver to unlife 
yesssss  my fav segment  mr beast idea  i read 150 philosophy books and still somehow want to live
i love your book reviews and i hope to see more in the future 
you are boring nowadays but that does not mean i will not stop supporting you
bruh why did i say this
felix are you never ever going to play a horror game again 
i always enjoy felix s deep thinking videos  helps my head everytime  
three cheers for self control   
your subs are natural   his are paid bots  
hello pewd 
pewdiepie has been such a positive cultural force in a time when we have needed it most  a true hero of the internet 
you stopped grinding felix  that is why you have been surpassed  you are fine clearly  you still have a multi million dollar personal brand  but your reign has ended  you were the first king of social media and you will always retain that title  yet no king can reign forever  you could have been the biggest for longer if you kept evolving  but why would you  you already have everything you want  hope you retire in grace  fade into the background like a pleasantly sounding end of a jazz instrumental 
trolzd
yeo
48 laws of power didn t even make this list 
both pewdiepie and mrbeast are epic
king of youtube   pewdiepie lord of youtube   ksi prince of youtube   mr beast
i absolutely watched the entire thing   i love him
c mon  give us the happy wheels part 847 
does not matter how many people may surpass you on numbers  for me  you remain the greatest
you should try cosmos
         
like for good christmas gifts  
since you have reached a scalable mental status  try reaching for the bhagvad geeta next 
come on make a distrack we can move past coco
happy wheelsss
i actually enjoyed this  keep it up  king 
you will always be the king of youtube  for me and for a lot of people 
after almost 2 weeks he makes a video on it 
pls do more book review
i know there is zero chance you see this pewdiepie but you would love checking out indie publishers who specialize in translating obscure literature  wakefield press snuggly press and the translator brian stableford are all right up your alley get the book of monelle from wakefield press  i guarantee you will love it
omg felix  cannot believe you want to collab with pewdiepie  do not you know hes problematic 
good to see you enjoy stoicism marcus aurelius tha mfn goat fr
to be fair you do not bait your audience with real money 
some books i recommend   benjamin franklin s autobiography the willpower instinct  how to win friends and influence people beyond good and evil human nature and the social order
book club is back
you will always be number one in our hearts felix kachjelberg or whatever it is
i too am a stoyke
i love book review so much
2 05 craving is suffering  you had one  and then you had another and another  me  but you crave books  you had another and another
someone save this man from japan 
you literally uploaded this 1 hour ago and he is 118m now wtf
well you do not pay people  so there is that 
still felix will remain numero uno because of all things he has done for this platform    
should have done happy wheels
 epic tits us 
some day  someone will pass mr beast  that s normal  what you achieved never will be forgotten  thanks for years of entertainment and now for wisdom hahahaha  
once a floor gang  always a floor gang   
ayo you are still the nb most subned youtube in all of youtube to do it all by urself  the others who channels who passed you did not get their subs all by their selves they got help  like a community
cannot concentrate on anything he is talking about because of that bump under his nose 
read journey to the west
how dare he pass you at s ubs  
it would be very nice of mr beast to delete his channel and honor his word  i would subscribe afterwards
                                                                                   
this is going to get those subs up  damn straight
sure i watch pewdiepie everyday  if there is new video
mr beast has more subs because the man gives away money like crazy lol
piewdiepie would make a great muslim    quran review would be interesting 
ahhh yayyyy finally book review is back   everyone peace has been resorted to the world
the best book in the world is al quran  and then afterwards al hadith books   prophet said those things are not in quran or hadith is denied  you should follow what holy scriptures says  and banned all the illogical books  things you know by good logic and reasons  and read this holy scriptures are top and mainstream  and pewdiepie talking style is mainstream and whole lifestyle rubix cube solver like me  i together whole lifestyle rubix cube solve philosophy and push it like a powerball to people  and i think pewdiepie is a that type of person  so  pewdiepie will understand it  and stop wasting your iq and blood sweat and tears by reading those illogical and bad books 
i do not know if this is just me but it feels felix would be an awesome friend for everyone here  i do not know it just feels like that to me  i feel happy just seeing his videos   dudes a legend  and this is like the dumbest thing to say but i once heard this song called  legends never die  so legends never die  but still awesome man
s ubs
i hvnt subscribed to pewds yet  1 day when he needs that 1 sub i will come to rescue or mr beast offers me to sub him then that is another scenario
not going to lie  the happy wheels part 200 sounded a lot better  
i love this man so much  had such a massive influence on me  shaping my sense of humour  perspective on life and personal philosophy  he is even inspired me to start working out   love you and thank you  felix  frfr
sure
it is really inspiring and uplifting to see that he is continuously pushing himself to grow and mature and be better  but not in a toxic way  even after achieving what is arguably peak success  he might not directly acknowledge it but he is a great role model 
frfr
 mr  beast  wish he could be compared to felix  pewds achieved all this using as little human and finantial resources as possible  whilst other channels like t series  cocomelon and even the so called  mr  beast are pretty much a whole corporation with huge production teams and a blank cheque amounts of money  and all pewds ever needed to succeed was a good personality and a camera  not money  i am not nor will never be subscribed to that little ostentatious daddy s boy s channel 
waiting for mrbeast to comment    
funny things is  all the things felix told about these books in start about philosophy has already been told by lord krishna himself  just read bhagwat geeta and you will understand that all they are doing is repeating what has already been told by krishna himself in kurukshetra war to arjun 
i actually really enjoyed this content  even though it is a little different  i have been interested in a lot of the things you talked about for awhile  so i appreciate the book recommendations 
pewds trying to ironically be boring but accidentally makes it a banger
where is the diss track pewds 
you should play happy wheels  has been to long  
i am not sure if you have heard of it or read it already  but one of my personal favorite books is a book called the bible  it is really great you should 100  give it a read if you have not already 
you ll always be king   
we could have had happy wheels with pewds  omg  
sukses selalu ya
s                  ubs
this video will get views
hope you read bhagavad gita at some point
this video is a perfect example of staying calm after your arch nemesis passes you in subs
i guess now that you passed the torch you can retire with peace in mind  
you should play dota 2 with jacksepticeye  
here before the title changes to  subs  instead of  s ubs 
i need happy wheels
people think that philosophy is useless but it is exactly the opposite  our every thought and action is being dictated by the view we have of the world  philosophy is actually the most practical and most important of all human activities  studying philosophy with an open mind  truly open though  can change our view  prejudices  and improve meaningfully our mental and physical health  it is the mother of all civilization  literally what brings us higher than the animal level  cultivating our humanity  of course  i would not dare say that all philosophical schools are  equally  beneficial  i think that studying the schools that focus on examining and understanding human nature can be a great foundation  the first three books that felix recommended are among my personal favorites  thank you  felix  for exposing big audiences to philosophy  you already know that subs and numbers are far from important  gratitude  i wish you a happy and fulfilling life 
i remember when mr beast tried to help you beat t series and he was much smaller  but now he s gotten himself into the big boy leagues  you ll never be forgotten  felix  your name stands in the tuber hall of fame
so what
wewe  dielive
finally  do more book reviews
next  read the quran
no the bible
read the vedas  the quran  and the bible
i like to think self control as a way to achieve your objectives  because our thoughts and actions will always be controlled by external internal stimulis  but our ability to think about ourself and our surroundings gives us the ability to plan things out in such a way that will benefit us  at least based on our existing knowledge experiences  and if we can just follow that plan then we can sure achieve a lot  but to do so we need to have self control and disicpline so that external stimulis do not change the course of our decision in a negative way  again the plan decision we make is not always going to be right  we need to go through multiple iterations and get feedback from where we plan do things wrong  and improve upon it  this continued cycle of self reflection  accompanied by discipline can really help one achieve a lot of their goals  at least this is what i think  and i am trying to follow 
you should write another  more serious book 
so what he passed you  that guy s a clown   
cool
that kelly clarkson moment was so funny
aun as  sigues siendo el mejor y el que m s ha llegado solo lejos
hands down it might be one of the most favorite videos beside discussing adult grown up thoughts and materials  it shows humbleness  accepting philosophy admiring it  king of youtube  
philosophy is a need for religion
pewds you will always be the og   the first youtuber in history to have the most subs  
what is a book
i think i have watched him grow up
epicurian boys represent
bold of you to assume that any of can read
man i haven t watched felix in so long this feels so good and nostalgic
fingers crossed for a felix x pewdiepie collab
lol book review
happiness   enjoying life
i did not know felix can read  
s ubs 
we can still say that pewdiepie is still the most subscribed youtuber who sits in his room and create pogger vids 
at one point these are going to become so specific that people will be saying  pewdiepie is still the most subscribed swedish youtuber that lives in japan and makes content alone in his room and is called felix 
i got into philosophy books because of pewds and now i am addicted
he must  he must avenge you  t series shivering right now
if i may suggest to you to read the holy quran 
you tube is just as bad as insta nowadays but there s quality information on here as long as you stay away from youtube shorts it s ok kind of
this was a very interesting video and i think very helpful to young people    thanks felix    you ll always be my king of youtube       
lol i am taking an intro to philosphy class and felix touch on a lot of the same philosophers 
no worries  you are still our king 
one day everyone will be because you stoped making horror gaming videos i do not know about anybody but i came for horror games i even found you first on horror game but you stoped because you are scared of horror games 
bring back happy wheels 200 plz
the new king 
how about you play a game call minetools minecrafters i do not know something like that
felix is the philosophy teacher we need  he somehow translates the books he read so everyone can understand  god bless you  felix  you might not be number one on youtube anymore  but who cares about numbers  deep inside we all know you are still the number one youtuber  even after being retired 
anyone else remember mr beast saying he would delete his channel if he passes pewds
a lot of what you point out in these books can be found in christianity   good video  i liked your viewpoints 
what do you expect  i mean  mr  beast plays minecraft 
felix had a first guiness book of world records for the most subscribers in youtube 
no the sun is plasma
i will definitely read felix s book that will inevitably drop 
i was fully interested in the video until my man put god of war 3  at that moment i yelled zeus your son has returned and i bring the destruction of olympus 
you are still number one in our hearts
you are washed up  old boomer felix   give up now and let your time of fame be a pleasant memory 
very nice 10 10 felix  please respond    
genuinely love these videos bro  thank you
s ubs
we cannot take your legs because someone had already taken them
i swear i am ready to do another subscriber war because it was so fun to spread the word  watching people make billboards  post videos and fliers to subscribe to pewds but that is not the case now  felix is so kind  and intelligent he definitely grew over the years  i think most of us grew too even if we still have some child left in us  regardless who is the  king  of youtube i will always support him and i am sure you will too     
can we still get happy wheels part 200       
i would love to see pewds talking about philosophy more  i am trying to learn too and his humor makes it so fun and engaging
      
did you read quraan
i recommend reading the quran
i recommend the bible
pewds the throat goat 
you see  there is a huge difference between felix and jimmy and this difference is why i love felix more  if i have to make an analogy  watching mrbeast is like watching a blockbuster movie  it is just entertaining  meanwhile watching felix is like chatting with your best friend  i know this sounds parasocial but it is true  i feel more connected and relating to felix than i am to jimmy 
but that is a reality now it is not your era anymore friend  
for all you people needing to achieve on something read   the unfair advantage 
pewds minecraft is falling apart plz save it like you did last time
holy shit bro he grew so many subs to quickly 
the best book in the world is al quran  and then afterwards al hadith books   prophet said those things are not in quran or hadith is denied  you should follow what holy scriptures says  and banned all the illogical books  things you know by your good logic and reasons  and read this holy scriptures are top and mainstream  and pewdiepie talking style is mainstream and whole lifestyle rubix cube solver like me  i together whole lifestyle rubix cube solve philosophy and push it like a powerball to people  and i think pewdiepie is a that type of person  so  pewdiepie will understand it  and stop wasting your iq and blood sweat and tears by reading those illogical and bad books 
muslims suck
i was pleasently clickbaited
you will always a king
this one video has more value than all of mr  beasts videos combined
you two togehter got t series subs  
mr beast did not pass you  he joined you
mr beast is the least carismatic famous person ever  he just gives away money  nothing against the guy just  it is so boring
you are the original king of youtube felix  you are awesome 
t series  meh
at this point you should read the quran 
no the bible
get over 1b sub s to pass t series
you should read the bhagavad gita 
i needed this  i godamn needed this
this video is clearly fake  everyone knows finn got the enchiridion from mannish man in adventure time 
he is chaaaaanged
when pewds said this   mr  beast  delete your channel as promissed  i literally got goosebumps  cuz i do not know if this was a joke or we will see a day later  mr  beast s channel was nowhere to be found on youtube
of course it was a joke
we all grew up with felix  he will always be  1 to us  
pewdiepie > andrew tate
honestly so happy and humbled to have watched pewds and his community grow and blossom as better people  from the humble and humorous beginnings  albeit ridiculously immature  of the  bro  army  you could see the change in mindset and influence  mentally and physically as well  life choices were made  healthier and more thoughtful decisions  learned from  and continued to grow  you could see hus phases   eras  of felix that really tied to his audience as well  the happy go lucky young felix playing video games and making jokes however he goes   famous fabulous  felix meeting marzia  jacksepticeye and markiplier  and starting youtube projects  guest starring in interviews  conventions  shows  etc   felix moving places  adapting to different and healthier lifestyle  clashing with differing ideals  making mistakes  learning from them   felix making different phase of content and even different personas  expands community  gets into an internet war and representing creators vs corporations on youtube  makes friends with creators like mrbeast  expands awareness and community even moreeeeeee  and his radar passes the target audience  felix and marzia starting multiple businesses  collaborating with brands  better lifestyle upgrade and even encourages the community to be more fit and healthier  the highs of the fast paced life slows down  people come and go  people no longer really look forward to youtube rewind and pewds is no longer most subbed on youtube but still reigning king of youtube   vlogs and less intense content to match the calm and lowkey phase in life  felix and marzia get married  they got married   they move places  and a whole new chapter starts once again now he still makes content  but with more love in his life  privacy  mentality  and well being  it s so nice to see how far we ve grown  here s to the end of 2022 
new copypasta just dropped
the book choices are deeply connected with the video s title
bro just gave us a philosophy ad
the apprentice has become the master
i appreciate the way you have evolved over the years  for the  now former  number one youtuber to accept passing of the torch by posting a 12 minute video introducing philosophy makes me proud of this generation of creators 
but i still want that mrbeast rap to uphold the tradition 
imagine being so sad that you reply to peoples comments convincing yourself that you re better than a person on the internet and crying yourself to sleep at night because you re one of the most useless individuals this world has ever faced
 mr  beast  wish he could be compared to felix  pewds achieved all this using as little human and finantial resources as possible  whilst other channels like t series  cocomelon and even the so called  mr  beast are pretty much a whole corporation with huge production teams and a blank cheque amounts of money  and all pewds ever needed to succeed was a good personality and a camera  not money  i am not nor will never be subscribed to that little ostentatious daddy s boy s channel 
 chepulis he didn t make a rap for set india
yes  well said 
la alih ala allah
just buy more submarines
omg felix  that is why i love your channel  f  awesome 
i do not know why but i thought this was a lwiay or ylyl video when i saw the the title and thumbnail
well i would suggest rumble  sub2rumblepewds
a pass me down 
you should read the selfish gene by richard dawkins  great read and makes you understand biology and evolution
same
your still number 1 in my book b  and according to google too
6 46 i do not have them
what 
let us gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
ahahahahah
  it should have been happy wheels part 200
yess it has been too long since the last book review  i want monthly book review xd
even if your subs lower than him you are still the king of the youtube 
this feels illegal
i wondered how you would play this off  like  maybe memes  or a message  nope  book   review   letsgo edit  good summary for a nice foundation  
20 fps camera got me like  
pewdiepie stays king
at the end you re saying to have a balanced of everything  have a little stoicism mixed with optimism  optimistic nihilism  and some cynicism and pragmatism while controlling your desires   of course a philosophy at it max isn t good such as stoicism which encourages you to suicide and not have hope  buddhism to remove all desires problem is desire is required for purpose and motivation  there was a research study where they chemically removed all desire of rat  they saw even when it was hungry the rat didn t eat because it had no motivation 
felix  twitter and instagram are bad habits  also felix  uploady lots of video to youtubez  
   fk yea pewds
i listened to epictetus a few times he is pretty interesting
still waiting for the mr beast diss track
read books trying to fill that void with knowledge from people that died in the end anyway  clearly it does not really matter as long as you feel good  and the people around you feel good   l ter som du beh ver fokusera p  sj lvinsikt mer  n l sa b cker felix  l r dig orientera dig i dig sj lv och din omv rld  s  kommer det blir l ttare  tills du t nker p  saker som g r att du f r huvudverk s   r det b ttre att inte t nka p  n tt en stund
craving is suffering  said by every millionaire ever 
i love how this video of a book review is just a subtle message to mr beast to realize you can t find happiness in things and achievements  you will always want more and that will make you miserable 
namaste
felix  look up absurdism 
he may have passed you in subscribers  useless number anyways  but you are still ahead in views by a long shot  
do mrbeast diss track 
i wonder when he going to read about islam
well the problems with wealth and fame are that they do not actually promote well being they just make you feel like you are well for a moment 
s ubs 
a
how is this the same guy who made bitch lasagna
pls make one day a philosophy slender
you are the king   
yesssss he did the copium meme
the end of pewdiepie is upon us
every single book felix recommended is a super hit  big ups to you  felix  for using your platform to spread the importance of knowledge  philosophy and stoicism especially now  when society needs it the most 
read the quran
you know your life is shit when you are taking life advice from pewdiepie
  this man always tries to do something new and extraordinary and makes his audience feel excited for every next video  hats off to him     
dude what the duck is this video  he is dropping all the facts in one video 
waiting for mr beasts comment 
    99  of comments here be like  he never fails to make us laugh his content never disappointed us 
  dear   those who are reading my comment at this time  we are all unaware of each other  yet o pray to god that there should be no tension in your life and you will always be happy     
i fucking love pewdiepie  book reviews  his interests  memes  horror letsplays  he deserves to be the king of yt so much  
goat shit to be honest
kind of forgot about mrbeast  that shit s wild  
just gave a speech on virtue ethics at my college tonight  funny coincidence
you have declared 
we love book review  
pog review
dang if aristotle thought women had less teeth than men  does that mean my hero alexander the great thot the same 
he is accent getting worse everytime
it does not matter pewds  subscribers is just a number  what matters is how people still see you as the youtube king  i love both mrbeast and pewdiepie  but i have been watching you since i was 7 lol  so i still say you are the best   
book   review  
waiting for mr beasts comment
if you love nietzsche you should read  memories  dreams reflections  by carl jung    as far as we can discern  the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being 
because he puts in more effort than reacting to shitty reality tv 
this video made me hungry  i give in  time to eat   
i laik buk  gud buk
i want to learn more about buddhism
you need to know about jesus 
 ashley are  nah i am already buddhist  atheist
pubmed says on average men do have more teeth than women  even though women have better periodontal health 
thanks for sharing another book review  you ve inspired me to dive more into philosophy but also reading books more and more every year
i do not read books books are for stupid people  
all eyes on mr beast
you sure know how to sell burgers   now i want one   note   just one   for now 
mr beast do something for his followers  felix 
the apprentice surpassed the jedi
i remember the days that mr beast praised the king  but now they are the king 
my option pewdiepie will always make banging content   
as a buddhist i approve this  do not reply saying  who asked if you do so i am going to reply with your ip adress
you need jesus 
mr beast channel is more likely a company   it has a shop of its own  100 of peoples work there and not managed by a single person  and there is felix   who has been serving out for years single handly  there might be hundreds of  youtube gods  but not another one like felix
i wonder how mr beast going to react to that last part 
mrbeast can pass t series for pewdiepie    maybe  just checked how many subs they got
quick everyone  make a third youtube account and sub to pewds
finally this is what we were waiting for 
i like how mr beast did everything in his power to promote your channel  then destroys you afterwards
happiness is to be comfortable and without need
bro got the philosophical rizz
my reformed orthodox rabbi felix speaks the truth 
mr beast video is not my cup of tea  his videos always giveaway money and giveaway money and giveaway 
so happyness   nothing that can be taken away from you but anything can be taken away from you
s ubs 
book review but no doki doki soundtrack  feels sad man 
mr breast
it appears the student has bested the teacher
pewds is still the most subscribed to  youtuber  mr beast is a company with well over 100 workers 
 mr beast passed me in s ubs  
bro just read the bible  he does everything except
it is over   
he knew that this video would get a lot of views so he did an episode of one of his least performing series  respecc
look at how broken pewdiepie is over this  the s being seperated from subs in the title says it all 
let s get one more happy wheels
nicomachean ethics is a fantastic book  and felix s explanation absolutely doesn t do it justice  granted  it s hard in a short clip  if you want to improve your life  this book is a great place to start  you ll have to take a lot of time to understand it though  use the internet  reread paragraphs  when you grasp the concepts  you gain such profound knowledge 
 
i was actually looking for philosophy books to read thanks felix 
disstrack on mr beast  hmmmmm 
  you are still our legend king  one day your time will come
when are you going to try resident evil 8  dlc since they added what happens after the death of the father
someone s  getting woke kudos
eudaimonia spells ef the monia
s ubs
still love you more than that idiot donkeybeast
it is like that tmnt meme
n n or we can take the shortcut and listen to diogenes of cinopea and learn to be contempt for who we are  because like siddh rtha gautama realized under that tree at the brink of life and death  a life of austerity is not worth living   your understanding of the classics is amazing  n n i want to hear you dissect nietzsche once again and bf skinner now your brain is almost as big as your biceps 
i love you so much dude you are the man    you all please remember this king forever i do not want him to be ever forgotten 
hey pewds  so happy that book review is back again  really love your thoughts on these books that talk about philosophy  anyway i would love to recommend you to read works written by albert camus  basically  camus talks about a lot on creating meaning out of the absurdities that come with the experience of life  i hope you could review one of his books in the next book review  namely  the stranger  the plague  the myth of sisyphus  the fall  and the rebel  looking forward to it if you happen to stumble upon my comment  lol cheers and much love 
read marx 
yoo there is not even a single sub up like damn it was 111 its 111
now pewdiepie is irrelevant cuz he has a smaller number than mrbeast
pewds if somehow you found this comment  id recommend the best selling book of all time  the bible  godbless you  brofist <3
amazing i want more
omgggggg boook reviewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
you bast and mr beast bast   
mr beast is truly a beast but pewdiepie revolutionized youtube 
i love pewds
have you read albert camus  work  i would really like your take on absurdism 
plz more book reviews
seeing felix using his smart ass 1000iq brain   
not sure when vid was made but now he at 118 mil  he is growing so fast  was subbed to him at like 14 mil
this is the best day of my life 
soooo  can we expect a second book eventually 
felix talking about these massive ideas of existence and of purpose that he learned from reading amazing mature literature is the exact meaning of when we used to say  can you explain in minecraft terms   coming to life 
finally  mrbeast is way better and king   of youtube
                                                          
s ubs
to be honest even if mr beast or cocomelon have more subs than you  you will always be the absolute main icon of youtube  even though i have stopped watching you  i still feel like you were and still are the king of youtube 
i like to think that all edgy nihilist memers eventually turn to optimistic nihilism
me beast sucks
from the way you talk about these ideas i d recommend animal liberation by peter singer
pewds grew so fucking much along with his audience
s ubs
women that speak out of place have less teeth than men  that is also why the smart women wear glasses  because you hit someone that is wearing glasses
to be honest  what i really love here is that felix did not diss mrbeast even if he passed pewdiepie in subs  this just shows how much the two are friends with each other 
love the video  you are still the king of yt
one day carryminati beats you in subscriber base but the fact is he already beats you in everything 
i are not got time to think about this shit  my baby s hungry  my taxes are due  and my back hurts 
this shows that money can literally buy anything 
pewds casually click baiting us into life improving philosophy 
happy wheels part 200  anniversary edition or riot lol
amazing
i love book review 
hold up  wait a minute   this was another level video and i expected something like old pewds type video  this guys is humble simple and so kind  
lovely video pewds  you are book reviews an philological discussions have always been my favorite type of videos  tack tack
pewdiepie has been the king of youtube since forever  
even though jimmy has more subscribers  felix s fanbase is way stronger  mrbeast has more young subscribers  so he obviously will make more kid friendly content but pewdiepie s target audience is not children  his content for his already existing audience which is why he does not get so many new subscribers  he still gets an huge amount of subscribers  but not as much as he used to make or rather how much he would make if he did let us plays  like in the old days  this shows how much he cares about making his existing fanbase happy rather then shifting his fanbase from time to time  his channel is not attracting a young audience like he used to make  now he matured and instead of building a new fanbase he let his fanbase mature with him and that is why pewds is in my eyes the number 1   
well  now i want a damned burger
making bookreview funnier is the best thing feelix  
imagine mr  beast actually delete his channel
one cannot think about youtube without thinking about pewpewds
ignorance is bliss happiness is not caring how many teeth women have
mr beast is super cringe though 
agreed
i recommend the book called   the art of living a meaningless existence  by  robert pantano it talk a lot about the same issues the book you have recommended to us and kind of summarize some of the views presented in them 
pewdiepie the many worlds theory is false  there is simply no way that you can observe it nor detect it  its not science  its fiction 
you like existentialism too 
tell me about it
the choice by edith eger would be a great read for you  i think
ultimate review  no bitch lasagna can reach this level of brain expand state 
mr beast is a traitor
the thumbnail is hilarious though xd
you read asthavakra geeta in english  it is mind blowing 
never stop reviewing books felix   and where is that catchy doki doki lit club music 
book review is my favorite series
this is good  
i would love if you read quran  learn more about islam 
agreed man  the guy needs islam in his life 
no he needs to read the bible and so should you 
 ashleyr6809 dude  do not you think he has already done that    we are giving him alternatives  
 ashleyr6809 sorry bro but i do not want a book that has like 5000 different editions of it  when was the last update by the way  
i have a feeling that you will not even accept a single compliment now   love you man  
top 10 anime fights 2022
a literal piece of toast could pass pewds in subscribers and i still wouldn t count it   1 man s epic journey to stardom beats out any subs mr beast could ever accumulate 
how could t series do this 
book   review  
you are just a guy with an editor  mr beast is very similar to a company  has many people working on the channel  it even has a spanish dub channel 
the way i was just thinking of watching a book review and then this was posted
yo pewdiepie are you going to read the quran
he better 
most of the way he takes life is like the teaching from the quran  i was amazed  
i like how he is not angry at mrbeast  but i cannot stop thinking how good a diss track titled  beast  would have been
felix proved why having pets and wearing black clothes is another level of hell 
jesus is lord  buddah is not  buddah is dead  jesus raised from the dead  buddah still rots 
es por qu  no pones en espa old tus videos
clearly aristotle s wisdom teeth had grown in and his 12 year old bride s had not 
it is over bros  
quem diria emm  
what   11 57
is  watching pewdiepie videos  a bad habit 
you should make one last happy wheels video and bring back  how s it going bros    it s peewdieepieee   i miss those days so much  
i love the perspective  along with many of those as well as other works by the same authors  one more recent work that helped me was  the abolition of man  by cs lewis  some philosophy more on human behavior 
 mrbeast delete your channel as you promised  
thanks pewds  love me some buddha s words   was just thinking this morning that i need a condensed way to absorb his teachings  and then you deliver   because you do not care about subs   buddha would be proud bro  which is something else not to care about 
 mr beast for president   
felix is still the king of youtube to us  i remember being a litter girl when he become the 1 youtuber 
always keep your expectations low and you will never be disappointed   kratos  god of war  2018 
i really appreciate his interest in philosophy
happiness really suits felix and even after years of doing youtube he still finds the joy in it  even in retirement 
maybe aristole s wife was not very wise
oof big l
i am so jealous of people of readind books
i love how humble felix is  showing that after many years of doing youtube  he is not just about gaining subs but doing what he loves
how dare mr beast  you were supposed to be the chosen one 
bro in my heart  you are still the king of youtube for me
please never end the books reviews  
always enjoy what you have to share with the world   appreciate your time and dedication   
you ll always be the king of youtube no matter what felix  even if you re retired lol
unsubbed from mrbeast 
so um subscriber war 3 
you do not deserve this channel
l mrbeast is beast is better   not racist
t series got 234m sub
 pewdiepie please collab with this guy  he looks up to you so much that he did a book review on your book  and he badly needs subs
man i just love epictiddies
i got an ad for the stepmother and the first thing i heard was you got to move on i started dying
to be fair  mrbeast has evolved his channel so much now that it is a whole team that makes videos possible at the scale they are at now  felix is still just him and sive that make the videos happen   the og is still the og 
we love you are book reviews
pewdiepie when t series about to pass him   let us play fortnite pewdiepie when mrbeast passes him  my greatest weapon  book review
jesus is coming 
no matter how many s ubs  pewds will always be king
pewds give perennial philosophy a try  you ll love it 
my favorite part is that mrbeast has 3 million more subscribers from the time this video was filmed 
you will always be my monarch    you beautiful butterfly  you 
the evolution of pewdiepie is definitely an interesting one  in a positive way too  which is rare 
promoting your own book at the end 7 years after its release lol
ok ok i suppose i can stop being depressed and read a book  it always helps and somehow you always post one of these videos when i am in the thick of it   thanks for the video pewds
galatians 5 22 23  but the fruit of the spirit is love  joy  peace  patience  kindness  goodness  faithfulness  gentleness  self control  against such things there is no law
legends
i want to see marzia and you getting scolded by a local chef when trying to cook typical dishes  the less english she he speaks the better it is
proud of you <3
please stop calling epictetus   epic titties   i m dying  
can someone make a list in the comments of the books pls
my respect to you felix  you are a legend<3
i still think you are the king  mr beast is more of a group  you are just one 
pewdiepie trying to teach the tenets of buddhism from the nirvana he has here on earth lmfao baby no
we need happy wheels part 200 400 
never thought you will talk about books
you must be new here
i thought he is going for mrbeast dis  
wow
you were the first person to reach 100 million subs  stay happy
mrbeast gained 3 million subscribers since you looked at his 115 mil  
felix being so stoic  he does not even care that he never had legs 
not shocked mrbeast has 4 channels 3 link back to the main channel extra traffic there
who else is ready for the mrbeast diss track 
nah they do not have beef
 v0ism i know lol  but i think it would still be cool
being not mad at the gps is something i can never do  sorry gps  p
i missed book review sm thanks felix    
bring back beast masters
pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  a gamer  a news presenter  a gym bro  a philosopher  basically an older brother we have never met but became a significant part of our lives 
        autism
yea
actually gloria borger is the news presenter not pewds 
 snowygalaxy as if it is bad
edgy  that is okay 
 snowygalaxy if you actually witness people who had a real parasocial relationship  they are totally way crazier x d
i like how you re insinuating that mrbeast is a phase  because you re right  the guy has zero talent and zero entertainment value  i m really hoping his hype dies out someday  meanwhile  i ve watched pewdiepie for >12 years every now and then  and he remains funny and sincere
 kevin eriksson dre this is you  
t series is above these two youtubers lol
he s not ever a good youtuber he s boring
pretty sad ngl
 angelothompson186 are not they also dead 
calling pewds a philosopher is far stretched  lol  he is a great guy  do not get me wrong  but he is certainly not a philosopher
true  
 
go take a shower
zura  you are not wrong
do not ever forget the editors
        what are you doing here then 
 patrick39your garbage stop makeing these comments
this  yes  thankyou for understanding me
 lyq232  
 bruh bruh i hate these guys stop them
this is the perfect depiction  
are you ok 
 epicmemer5277   who 
this isn t pewdiepie  this is felix  didn t you hear him saying he wanted to collaborate with pewdiepie
 somebodyherefornow truly correct  indeed 
 bruh bruh cope harder
and a veteran
 a philosopher  lmao
so he is johnny sins of youtube
shut up bro
perfect summary  chefs kiss
he is the same age as me and i really look up to this guy
        noob
dawg he is just a youtuber
he is almost like a climate we all live in  and it is changing  
so incredibly sad and parasocial
this is exactly how it always feels
pewdiepie is best
amen 
parasocial relationships smh
 kevin eriksson dre  
he is basically like andrew tate
he is the inky japanese person i know 
is dis da new copy pasta
gym bro  nah bro
this is so corny  
to me he is more of a friend that i secretly have a crush on
 katsura i mean he s a cool guy in his videos but youtube in general should not be a significant part of your life i d assume 
i am a better step bro than pewds
it s a phase
he said the n word on stream lmao
younger bro for some 
 lyq232 it is
and pewdiepie does not splash money on people faces to gain 111mil subs   
 kevinerikssondre4300 great thinkers of past are dumb  
 geompon6505 pov you are a child
zura 
comment of the year 
pewdiepie is actually like a father to me
thanks zura
dude  you really think this is all pewdiepie  pewdiepie is the gamer  poppy harlow and gloria borger are the news presenters  felix kjellberg is the gym bro and philosopher  get it right next time
p a r a s o c i a l
saw him as a dad at first but as i was growing older  i realized he was a true older bro  remember the funny montage videos he made  good times 
i grow with felix  i was thinking he love gaming  money change people  i m happy i don t make money like him and still enjoy my games
la alih ala allah   
amen bro
you gay bro
cool but no one s clicking just because you said that
not that deep
no no it was a phase  after the minecraft series i fell off
very nice
the water sheep killer
        your about me is fuck off self promoters lol
gamer momento
relly me  
as someone who always wanted needed an older brother and grew up with pewds  i agree
i totally agree with you
 jonathan gervasi ignore report that account  it is just the dummy dum dum who wants people  s attention 
 spacerattheratfromspace7024 discrimination
 duckified  wow  he said a bad word  how will the world ever recover from that 
a chair flexing flex chairer 
he is always been a bro  has not he 
i would like to see pewds read  behave  by robert sapolsky to get neuroscience pilled on how humans work 
yes
you need to seperate life from videos 
 lyq232 against what group 
jesus christ is the propitiation for the whole world s sins  they that believeth and are baptized  with the holy spirit  shall be saved  but they that believeth not shall be damned  those led by the holy spirit do not abide in wickedness      god is one manifesting himself as three  the father  the son  and the holy spirit  bless him   for these three are one  as i am led by the holy spirit  nothing i state is a lie  but the truth of god  anyone who tells you differently is misinformed or a liar  they do not know god  nor led by him  anyone who  claims  to be a christian and is against what i am doing  and where i am doing it  the holy spirit does not dwell within them  they lack understanding  they know not god  read his word  and their religion is in vain  do not hear them  they will mislead you  the lost cannot guide the lost 
another truth many have been deceived of  when you trust in god and cast your cares  worries  anxiety  depression  suicidal thoughts  upon him  they will be no more   know that there is power in the name jesus christ  his name casts out demons and heals  the world is wicked  evil  and of the devil  i too  was a wicked sinner of the world before i opened my heart to god  i am living proof of god s work and fruitfulness  he is an active god who hears the prayers of his  god s children are set apart  holy  and righteous  the devil is a liar that comes to steal  to kill  and to destroy  that includes your relationship with god  open your heart to god  repent of your sins  he will forgive you  and let him direct your path  draw nigh to god  and he will draw nigh to you  cleanse your hands and purify your heart  lest you walk with the devil and follow him to hell 
true
jhonny pewdss

pewdiepie is a higher being
l opinion  mrbeast still won  cope salty pewdietard fan

 stadtjer689 bro why you praying and hoping on someone is downfall  like what did he do to you 
no its a phase

he was a coke dealer in 2016 
shut yp
this dude has never gone to a gym
 stadtjer689 same i have literally never watched mr  beast because he is lame  people say he is so nice because he gives away money but it literally does not matter because the amount of views he gets he is just making more money back
beastmaster64
 
very weird

 lyq232 yes that is bad

i am 6 months older than him
i agree with this
        gay
sounds like that talented bald guy named jhonny whatever that i do not know what he does because i am pure hearted 
zura nai katsura da
lol stop being para social
pewdiepie is everything
 user dh2mu5zr2y fr it can be better than him sometimes  but overall hes way better than you
         the best way to beat mrbeast again in subscribers is to start giving away money  people love to see charity 
hejdheos
 kelvindublin like 1 100 dollars lol mrbeast literally gave more than this lol
no
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ

 stadtjer689  >zero talent i mean  i agree  but all pewdiepie does is react to other videos  it doesn t require talent
yes
npc

he s also a racist 
        bro chill

 patrick39 oke i click the sub button 
mr beast the best
         no
and also someone who does not even know you and would rather save the life of a homeless cat over the life of someone who devotes their entire time watching him  for example someone like you
 abijose2793 what do you base your arguments on  meowbahh  you have less and still say it is better 
bruh
 sourishsrivast k
 sunislost  bruh
stop watching other live a life and go live yours 
 pewdiepie is not just a phase  it is a lifestyle  go touch grass
        why do you have so much liked bruuuuuuh
this is sad as hell
 katsura  that is because you have no life   making some online celebrity your fantasy friend   delusional  touch grass 
 not so sorry but you r wrong
hey someone put this 14yo back in his class
nope it s a phase he needs to make more scary or gaming videos in general
not older  actually about the same age  but still way more grown up and developed than me    
damn  that is a lot of praise for another grown individual  great guy but damn 
shuuut upp
what s his max bench
you forgot racist
not really
and a reaction youtuber
pewdiepie is a pie
true
this is a good deep comment  
lambonn
read quran  it will change you are life
agreed 
best philosophical book there is 
s ubs
you will always be  1 to me felix 
more book review please                  
it does not matter who has the most subscribers  they are both amazing 
pewdiepie
most humble youtuber ever   
nah bruh go watch his old videos  
delictable 
hey felix  what is your diet plan 
the stoicism book is now in my amazon checklist    
god is better than than stoicism
hello there pewds  d
sorry pewdiepie  he become the best one 
suscribe to mrbeast
11 59 bro  mr beast will literally delete his channel after listening to this     
reality is often disappointing 
mrbeast passed you in subs long ago considering all of his channel  but to me what you do is not even comparable  also the amount of money and people that go into his videos are uncomparable  you will forever be the og one many army 
both are youtube legends 
we still do not know much about the universe  when we reveal one answer we get two more questions from that answer 
ballin and virtue are my habits 
e
7 08  people die if they are killed
emiya shirou  is it 
i love book reviews so much  this series helped me get back into my reading habits and honestly i read some great books thanks to you 
book review is my favorite
what if what i crave is book review 
never imagined i would take a philosophy session with felix lol
maybe aristotle s wife was missing teeth and he thought  hmm yes  all women have less teeth   
don t worry felix  even if mr  beast has surpassed you don t forget that you re always the true king of youtube   
i didn t knew i would almost die laughing in a book review video         this video was epictetus
i agree so much about not sleeping on epictetus he s sick
i am sure he is read it already but for those who have not  i recommend man s search for meaning by viktor frankl  it is a short book but it is really good 
time for me has come  d
the best book review   
i mean from youtuber to now a philosopher  how good can this get  
more book reviews please  give us a short list so we can read it beforehand
the true lesson is who the fuck cares about how many subs  the best youtuber is obviously the yeaman bot 
he didn t just pass you he smoked you
the way i understand the first noble truth is not that  life is suffering  or existence is suffering  but suffering is inherent in existence  i read some were it was incorrectly translated to existence is suffering  with suffering is inherent in existence fits more with the rest of the philosophy
based video
play minecraft bruv
you collab with t series your sub boom   
wewe dielive
props to pewds for becoming a full scale philosopher   now i know that the countless hours of youtube i watch  is putting me on the right path   
         
hello  how are you 
book review x mr beast video  today good day 
i loved the pewds vs t series race  what a fun time  so fun to see how relaxed you are now though  it is cool that you just share stuff that you like and do not care about all the metrics 
i love book review
to be fair you have been at 111m for the past 3 years
i have also declared that the books sound interesting
one of my favorite quotes comes from my best friend   life is complicated  it is full of potatoes  i have no idea what that means
s ubs
history right here
pewdsss i hope you make a legends of the brofirst 2 please 
l subcount  but w content
for the last couple videos  i cannot stop looking at felix s desk lamp as part of a cat s head  like those weird egg mold things   the side of the head  with the ear 
you should do happy wheels 200 for the memes
honestly  i subscribed to both of them   
there was once a time when mr beast did extreme advertisement for pewdiepie lol    epic book review  
 
mrbeast is getting a million subs a week
when was the last time you stirred up significant controversy  been long long time   real popular to go to war with the adl these days   really do not have to do much to get um foaming at the mouth either 
 
wow  enchiridion by epictities  
what a great review felix  d
surprised japan even uses gps i guess because the us military pressense 
the fact that pewds held the  1 spot for this long and then was so humble about mr  beast is so refreshing to see  pewds will always be king of youtube lol
when i heard the idea of pewds doing a book review  i never thought i would like it since i am not a reader  but after all of these book reviews  felix made me wanting to buy some to read
 you either die a hero  or live long enough to see yourself become the villain 
you will always be the goat of youtube 
help me get baypass surgery so he can see the likes comment here guys i need  20k i am in obesity level 4 
 mr beast challenged me to a fight   closet review 
okay  i kind of feel you try to defend nietzsche  but it kind of feels like you want to like him because he is popular nowadays and you want to like his work  i think he is ideas are pretty bad morally and he should not be praised because it makes people worse
doubt you will see this  but have you ever read ken lui  dandelion series 
stoicism is interesting  but it seems somewhat contradictory  at least in the way felix explains it  if good and evil are just things we invent  and not actually real  then how can we be truly virtuous  maybe even more importantly  why should we   as a christian  it makes more sense to me that god is the perfect embodiment of virtue  so we should try to be more like he is 
i have missed these book reviews and talks about philosophy about living life  i want to make flourishing as an individual my goal  i have already in a way but i did not have a word to sum it up  i want to keep that going  
i love pewdiepie  but mr beast is completely different beast
he went from bitch lasagna and pink cat ear headphones to reviewing a book on buddhism
fuck yessss book club is back babyyyyy 
although mrbeast has passed him in subscribers  he is still about 9 billion views behind  a win for the bros
yes i really enjoyed this video      i m glad we re talking about all this
me waiting for  beast lasagna  to drop
mrbeast is not a youtuber  it is a company  pewdiepie is still number 1 
2 12  so i m hungry  i crave food  i m suffering because i crave food  once i get food  i won t be suffering anymore  but then i will get hungry again  your point you just made is to never give into your cravings  so you will never eat and then you will die within a month  how the fuck does that even make sense
click like to claim your  here within an hour token 
bro if you got into religions  read quran you ll thank me 
no the bible
 ashleyr6809 isn t he a christian 
honestly mrbeast bought his way up with money  pewdiepie got his position with genuine hard work 
do not make fun of mr beast  he is just as amazing as pewds  i think 
this is not the video i expected but i am leaving satisfied  thank you felix
i ve been waiting for this for a long time
    
hi pewds
perfect video to watch in 12am whiles trying to sleep
books  in the buddhas words by bodhi nicomachean ethics by aristotle enchiridion by epictetus the gay science by nietzche our mathematical universe by tegmark
well i came here for stop a fight now i am 
yayyy book review 
mrbeast left the chat
having hated philosophy in school  you make it seem very interesting  and i m going to read some of these books because of you  and i think that s awesome  thank you for sharing this with us  
mrbeast are a bunch of miscarriages that did not flush   
honestly if being a better person is not your top priority you are doing it wrong
early gang here vvvvvvvv
book review 
bruhhhh
okay felix  hear me out  bro to bro   do happy wheels 200 as well
i missed book review  please make some more 
now thinking about it  once you past at least 10 mil subs  gaining them does not matter
i love this video and now i know a couple things i m getting for that christmas holiday thing 
wow phylosephy  you realy don t care any more   
you should sleep on epictities 
i love how the editor made that little blemish on felix s face so prominent throughout the whole video  what a butt face lol
i meant the editor is the butt face lol
the best cope video ever
the enchiridion is the best book i ve ever read 
 there is no right or wrong  we are the ones who created them   this is maturity  
so when is happy wheels part 200 coming out   
bravo to mr  beast  but respectfully  pewds will always be my king of youtube 
what can i say  that what in philosophy is taught as a fear  in imperealism is power 
long live the king
wait my philosophy has been stoicism all the time  ordered the book to confirm lol
subscriber count was broken when youtube started pushing shorts anyway 
you change
did not expect book review series to be up   might be able to expand my book list 
felix if you want a book recommendation then read quran  and if you do please share your review about it
pewds i would love see  you read qur an and make a video about it i am just suggesting it since i am a muslim of course it is up to you if you want to read it 
you mentioned in some stream you would read the quran
the things about accepting death as a part of nature is an interesting topic  i went through therapy at one point  hated it  but one of the few things i got out of it was a quote that i actually repeat often in my head   it is great that you are ready to accept death  i just do not want you to be the because of it  it was way in the past  but it went a long way and the idea stretched to other topics 
i not love now
pewds  do not take my legs aha  tricking us now  eh 
pewds camera goes crazy
wtf pewds made a big brain video
book  1 mein kampf
i never thought i d feel so enlightened pewds
that is crazy
it feels like he is speedrunning to 0 subs now  d but good for him  do what you want  do not became a slave 
find your peak again  
jimmy right now has 117m subs
i have declared that its funny
thanx felix nice video   helped me realize real lies   
i will say that i did not even recognize             the way you red it and i am greek xd
pewdiepie   king of youtube  
i still remember when t series passed him 
no hate on the guy  but god damn  i do not understand how anyone could watch misterbeast  the guy is the embodiment of cringe flex youtuber  and just because he is  generous  does not change that fact 
can we get a response book review from mr beast  battle it out guys
felix went a long way down the path of self betterment  and now with an audience that likes him for  da funnies  he still puts out this type of content to try and spread the message  and i respect him for that
at 0 50  i heard him say   there is a lot of repitition in metallica  lol 
happy wheels 
w reviews  try reading the holy quran its good  not trying to get you to islam 
you are still the no  1 to me
hello pewds
must be those totally legitimate giveaways beast does that i ve been hearing about 
i actually found this so helpful  definitely going to look into some of these books  thanks felix  
he literally ran an entire campaign for people to sub to pewds and still passed pewds up    
regardless if mr beast passed pewds  he is still the king in my book  now mr beast has to take down cocomelon   t series to save the world  kekw  thankfully we got   book review   last one is a great one to read  highly recommend it  danke for the book recommedations   i will if i can locate a few of them  hope your doing well  keep being awesome   safe bro      
haven t watched you in a long while  glad to see your book review back  
calm
hello pewds  i want trying to start reading more books and i want to say that i would really enjoy more videos about these kinds of themes 
damn
yooo book review
bro you need 7 more million to pass him
i am actually really pleased to hear about these books  i might end up trying to grab copies later 
maybe not happy wheels  but maybe we can get some guts and glory  i m ready for some cheap entertainment   this deep shit ain t for me 
nowdays pewdiepie content not good
bro does not care so much that he started filming this with all that dandruff hair on his tshirt with no fucks given
finally a book review  greetings from sweden  actually i just covered some philosophy of socrates and plato in my first youtube video  but it is mostly about the psychology behind our laughter  our humour  check it out  give a comment of what you think 
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh  stop being calm  someone toke your crown  xd
it is sad that this era shows us that everything has an end
finally  the time has come
i definitely didn t know when i clicked on this video that i m going to get schooled about life and learn good stuff  nice
to be honest i am not surprised  this dude is getting a shit load of views too  which is baffling to me  i can say that most people on youtube are watching this dude  never seen his videos once  but dabbled in his minecraft days  but i do say  he is just one of those cliche youtubers  with the type of content he makes  like what david dorbik did  i do not know  people are suckers for his type of content  it is not even intertaining  there is just some aspects of youtube that is dying  as well as gaming channels 
at least your channel isn t riddled with bots as much as mr  beast s is  also you should read 20 000 leagues under the sea  doesn t really go into philosophy but it has a lot to do with observing animal  plant and earth creation  exploring history  working with other peoples differences   a bit of isolation of ones self and it s generally entertaining to read at least for me because i love science fiction  it is obviously old fashion because it was written in 1870  it really made me want to pull out a huge sea tobacco cigar and smoke it reading a book about shellfish classification in captain nemo s library smoking room knowing damn well smoking is bad for my lungs  i hope you get a chance to read it 
when are you going to read the quran 
never  he should read the bible
 ashleyr6809 he can read them both i did not care
pass the torch moment  from pewds to mr beast  always watch pewds since i teenage 
you are still the undisputed youtube champ   
i love how felix went from being a kid who screamed at amnesia custom maps to an incredibly well read  articulate  and intelligent person and that it is all recorded  it is hard to not be optimistic seeing someone grow like that
my name
great comment and totally agree     
he was never a kid  he was just laidback
shut up bot
 slyceth well  seeing him doing that weird dance thing years ago to now is kind of crazy
barrels
he has always been intelligent  he just never revealed it  for his content was never focused upon it 
it s you dime a ne a  say it like that
scream at amnesia is normal  scream at amnesia and get millions of views are genius
no no he s still that kid
exactly  i feel as if i have grown with him 
 yeaman you do not have one
not to mention  naturally buff  viking style   
he is just old now  
look at the thumbnail lmao
   
but next amnesia upload when 
 yasssighs6034 hes 30 that is not old
 daredevil2724 30 is not old compared to 18 
 yasssighs6034 yea its is but just said old with no other context
 daredevil2724 you r right
la alih ala allah   
i miss the old days though
he still actually   mind   nailed it 
mr beast is still a big corporation  you are still the most subscribed solo  almost  youtuber
this was oddly refreshing do not get me wrong  challenges and giving away money is epic but seeing the crew messing around and destroying stuff really gives me that good nostalgia
lmaooo this bot did not even put this copied comment on the right channel  you had one job lmaooo
 krispbacon69 bruh then why 
 100ksubscribewithnovideo what crew  what challenges  what giving away money  what stuff are they destroying  lmaoo you are on the wrong channel bruh  and it is really interesting that i saw this same comment earlier  verbatim  in a mr beast video in which it was actually related to the video hmmm
guys is pewdiepie okay  i think he is having a sort of me talk breakdown after mr beast surpassed him  haha jokes aside i love how clickbaity the thumbnail is and people made the video informative and helpful  gg pewds
i have considered myself of the stoic thought for a long time now and the hardest part is i have clinical depression and although i have to accept what i can t control that means i have to accept irrational sadness and it can really get hard at times to rationalise the irrational  i tend to use habits as a way to help it but to an extent there is no getting away from it it s one of the biggest challenges i ve had at a stoic
 i have declared  is such a good line 
its actually 118 milli
the moment i feared most happend
 no more repetitions  please  i have declared 
i shall see you as the best youtuber even if that jimmy guy passed you  i do not like his video  they act weird 
i know you did not do this on purpose but this is exactly what a lot of random people that watch you needed to hear  thanks  meanwhile mr beast is trying to purchase 6 billion twinkies
pp gang
i really want a pewdiepie review on a book about islam
so no dissing rapsong nippon version 
at the end of the day mr beast got thoes 100m with a whole crew and lots of equipment pewdiepie got them all himself behined a desk and a computer  
you ll always be the king of youtube 
press f to respect
the gay sciences is such a great read 
      
 ashleyr6809 it is not that kind of gay   also do not speak in emojis  there is good reason hieroglyphics died out 
 please tell us more master 
mr beast disstrack let us go
this is your most intp video ever 
 pewdiepie since your into philosophy i would recommend to you to read advaita vedanta philosophy
lol if you had not done t series  bullshit then you would not even crossed 100 million
bro do try learning about islam  you will find it helpful in many ways  islam teaches the ultimate way of living 
no it does not  jesus is the way  the truth and the life 
an american who does challenge with a lot of money and donates a lot of money surpassed an swede who is doing book reviews and videos about living in japan  in other words  water is wet 
pewdiepie had a good run 
shi ha
i just came from spiritually group  i am a recovering addict  and so i go to multiple groups every week so i can stay sober  here is some philosophy from my counselor to you all  the real problem is not how to quit something  the problem is not starting all over again  if you find out why you think you need drugs  then you can address that  in other words  drugs are not the problem  they just exist  the real problem is why you feel like you need to use the drugs  once you address that then  the words of the hour  self control will then be in your grasp  love you all  hope you thrive wherever you all go 
no  now is the time for war   now is the time for violence     kidding of course  we love mr  beast 
he already made history
surpassed by a fan now that is legendary
pewds why do not you read an quran
someone please update that reddit thread about books he is suggested  last time i checked the past few videos were not there and it is a shame
mrbeast   subscribe to pewdiepie  pewdiepie   ends sub to pewdiepie    everyone proceeds to sub to mr beast 
pewds is just a simulation
is it just me or is the fps messed up
when felix said  we we dielive  my god  i cannot even begin to explain what i felt
buddhism be like cope i believe in midway path
naruto surpassing jiraiya sensei
you should read our thoughts determine our lives  the life and teachings of elder thaddeus of vitovnica and unseen warfare revised by st  theophan the recluse 
book review pagbounce
bru
every comment with one like is upvoted by the author himself 
unbelievable  i did not think it would happen 
we need a collab song  
i think it is time to hide in the old content
i love that out of the entire philosophical tradition pewds picks two of the funniest names 
love it
this is a pretty pretty good example 
felix  look into albert camus and his philosophy of the absurd  might spark your interest 
chill vibes i like it
those are some epictetus
i disagree that craving   suffering  if we do not crave want to do stuff  so what is the meaning of doing anything  
living in the moment not always wanting more
mr who
okay but give us the diss track now
he never will 
you should do a mr beast diss track
i highly recommend  the structure of scientific revolutions  it is super good 
when i first heard the news i was like  nice  felix probably won t care  and will in fact congratulate mr beast  lol
jimmy  i am mr beast  and today  i am locking all my friends in prison for a week   and then  shout  the winner gets xcar house money    success  he might as well partner with ryans toy review  felix  reviewing philosophy books the difference is clear  no hate but the age gap difference must be huge
bro get some sleep 
who says he dosent sleep  he s just reviewing books  
 kxmuna8367 look at his eyes bro  
 feister2869 he doesn t have dark circles or anything so i don t get your point  he just has small eyes have you never watched pewdiepie before  
the best way to reac to this honestly  with book review
i still think supporting him in the war helped
jimmy and felix are both legends among men
ffoookin love these
gg
even though mr beast and t series have more subs than pewdiepie now  i still consider felix the most subscribed person on youtube  mr beast has a whole team and t series is a fucking company  but pewdiepie does everything by himself  very impressive
yay book review is back
pewdiepie is still number one biggest youtuber in the gaming section  tseries is largest in the music section  and mrbeast is number one in irl content  ez dubs on pewdiepie 
i want some bitches but ill not give up to my desires and stay a winner for the rest of my life  and reach the ultimate buddha state 
unlike t series  mrbeast is one of those youtubers who earned his way and deserves a spot this high with subscribers  just like felix  he s a legend
you are using the word  repetition  a little too much  i hope you do not mind the  difference 
he does not care because he is not indian so it is fine  the day an indian youtuber surpass him  the hate will start 
what crazy is when you were trying to beat that company is subs   mr beast was at 15m subs and he literally got 100m subs in that span of time   although bro you don t even try your just funny and laid back and don t need to prove anything the accomplishments you have done bro is absolutely amazing much love pie  
both are legends  mrbeast surpassed you in subscribers when it seemed that it was not going to surpass you because of how far mrbeast was in subscribers
i love your book and philosophy videos  have you ever read boethius s consolation of philosophy 
real ogs remember when nigahiga was the most subbed on youtube
for years pewds has been the reigning chicken champion for years  now  mr  beast takes the chicken  history has been made tonight ladies and gentlefish 
now you are not top 1 but the legend and fanclub is watching everyvideo forever 
 if you want to improve  be content to be thought foolish and stupid                epictetus
i don t quite understand why we re reading about nikocado s ethics but anything for professor pewds
i m expecting mr beast to respond to this  
loved the content book review smashes
thank you for more book reviews  quite fun 
pewdiepie    picks buddhism summary as his first book  indian bros    
second book   aristotle indians praising alexander as the greatest ruler ever ruled    
third book     indian bros who love god of war   fukk ya
fourth book   gay science  indian bros     pick up the gun  
fifth book   mathematical universe asian bros    dab 
you still who you are    
this guy dose nothing with his  youtube prophets except fund his lavish lifestyle  at least mr beast makes creative content an helps people out once in awhile  i do not even think i have seen this guy give a homeless guy 10 bucks   
good now i can buy more books and not read them
felix   big brain   
he passed you in subs  you now must discombobulated yourself pewds
ill love to have a philosophical discussion with you
hydraulic press vs lamborghini < pewdiepie book review
we are from the future and mrbeast has also passed youtube music  
well he posts alot more than you  and his new videos are actually entertaining to watch  not much of a surprise here pewds
thought he was going to quote gold d roger when he said  wealth and fame  
i love these videos 
mrbeast before  i am learning history  mrbeast now  i am making history 
why does he look like someone is holding a gun behind the camera for him to make this video lmao
love how this guy has matured through the years 
nah  we still barely know anything about the universe and how everything works
book review 
i just want to say thank you felix for being a great example  stay awesome 
yea 
i want happy wheels
clickbait
pewdiepie s still number  1 no matter what
pewds will always be king
moar happy wheels please  
i don t read books  my bookshelf is just too impress girls i bring home 
0  disstracks 0  beef 100  bookreviews
thank you kelly clarkson
happy wheels please  we need one last one
don t forget what felix achieved  for nearly all of his 111 million subs  he has single handedly entertained us  that s a huge achievement 
clean your room
 dinogt8477who are you talking to bro  the bot 
nah  more subs   better person
same goes to mr beast too both of them entertained us
 no we4ux ludwig viewer be like
 taexyun mr beast haters see him as more of a company now because he works with a band of friends  you are not wrong  and unlike tseries  this was very much deserved but  pewdfans will say what they need to lol 
        you already are the most hated 
that fact he did it for so long too  withstood so much drama and many people trying to cancel and  copy strike pewdiepie  is beyond anything  seeing everyone come together to bring what could be his last big achievement on youtube of 100m subs was one of the most wholesome things i have witnessed
fuck felix mr beast >>>>>>
half of his subs are sub bots 
no shit sherlock
sive 
that is a big difference  because behind mrbeast is an entire team
i am sure there is a lot of pewds and mr beast fans subbed to both 
just like yo momma
what about the editors wtfs
 
 psychris  prove it
sive reading this   
 talaonce mizkif king inshallah
 taexyun he meant pewdiepie is a solo youtuber  while mrbeast has a whole team and entertains using a whole community of people 
 taexyun no offense but the comment meant that pewds has a smaller team behind him
i m subbed on multiple accounts so is it really 111 million 
 jonde2922 must be
100 mil is
he didn t give away money for subs
so sad that he passed you in s ubs
is sive a joke to you 
 jonde2922 that is true  
 no we4uxhe also didn t have to use the easiest thing ever to get interaction aka  money  to get famous like mr beast  if he stopped the hand outs then his channel would of never even reached 50 mil subs  of course he ll keep doing it because money is the simplification of the easiest entertainment  that s why there is a million game shows that have money as the prize 
 xn33dx why d you   me 
and he does not pay people for subs mr beast is just about  i payed this i payed that  lol
 taexyun although i love mrbeast and i enjoy watching him  he has a whole team setup and basically motivates people to sub in order to have a chance to win big money  pewds content is just reacting to stuff  nowadays 
he had help from gloria borger
let us be like pewds and not care
with help of his wife and his editor 
that is it  entertained us  i felt like you were building up to something more lmao
111 mil but 4 to 8 mil views per video  what a joke
la alih ala allah
don t forget the editor
rest in gold pieces of money that i have from ya felix 
 zangozzsive came way after  it s not that completely  i watched pewdiepie for pewdiepie  no for sive but still great
 bikeman1431don t spark a debate  
 jonde2922could apply to any youtuber really  it s not just pewdiepie  i m subbed on mr beast on my 3 accounts  but i don t even watch him anymore haha  i spam sun sometimes
 chippzlemonzfunny how we all read it differently  
        you are too lame to even deserve that hate 
beast the best
mr beast is more of businessman philanthropist felix is a dude with a cam  a pc and humour  and swears 
will jimmy delete his acc 
pewds will always be remembered as the king of youtube forever do not ever forget that  
favorite vid i have seen from you  very epic books  i m really interested in all these books  i shall woefully consume  the books 
pewdiepie will always be tthe king of youtube no matter what happens  
these videos of his are the best 
give the holy qur an a try
good video  still clicking off 
this is masterpiece 
pewdie kratos mr beast atreus
why did he write subs wrong  he wrote s ubs
lmao
kelly clarkson greatest philosopher of all time 
i googled  epictitties  she is really great philosopher 
king is a title given for life  mrbeast can be king the day you are no longer with us  hope of course we get a similar case in this  as in the reign of queen elizabeth ii  70 years holy heck 
i hope the title never changes and love the book talk lol
hey man can we get more landcruiser content  i loved it
me who is part of the buddhism religion   are you sure about that
mr beast has been and  will always be pewds fan   two kings
yay book review  i wish you do these more often 
mrbeast not making funny pewdiepie make funny
your telling me we could of got happy wheels   
the legend has returneddddd 
mrbeast   pewdiepie  
we will never forget what mr beast did for pewds when he was fighting against t series though
felix  you have pretty much 100  the game of life  i have no idea what you do now  even the side quests have been completed 
you should get back to news with poppy gloria i loved those videos  
waiting for mrbeast  s comment
this was amazing felix  thank you 
that 4 mil you need in going to come flooding in  books ftw 
hey  pewdiepie you are a one man army with 111m subscribers   the reason mr beast passed you is that he has a team of entertainment  
i wonder how much pewdiepie spends on each video  i know mrbeast takes many  many months and many  many dollars on each video  typically 
try gita
the are all great books and thanks felix  
finally
mr beast cringe  pewds entertaining
when diss track on mrbeast 
yeeees book review is back
you just now noticed this 
why you like my health teacher in this video  
man 
how about this  book review   happy wheels part 200  sounds like a good deal to me
quite a pleasant surprise this video was 
i watch pewdiepie everyday while having lunch 
now everyone made second multiaccount 
you will always be  1  i can honestly say i watch and enjoy all your videos and have yet to see one of mr beast s vids   
maybe you should go back to being actually funny then
we live we die i watch piediepie 
he will not delete it  no balls lmao
bruh epic titties  based 
face it old man  you are yesterdays news  let the young  rich  generous kid have the spotlight 
unbelibebol
editing on point 
mrbeast will surpass tseries and avenge you  mark my words
press f for pewds guys
disstrack 
i actually learned something new today from this  thank you  pewds 
read quran  it is life changing
you should do happy wheels part 200 anyway
i was here legend
the teacher becomes the student 
the moral of this video  stop crying and enjoy dying 
anime plot twist be like 
it was a matter of time old traveler 
i do not know why this is entertaining
i cannot stop looking at that huge bump on his upper lip  that huge bump has a huge shadow 
you can clearly see pewdiepie is retired  otherwise he would not make a clickbait video but a funny interesting vid  but i love it  its perfect
nice  another book review so soon 
felix  where can i buy jaffa cakes in japan  this is serious  i need them
i took a break from studying for my philosophy final to watch this video and now i need another break 
end of an era  pewds no longer number 1  crazy  it is been unchanging for years 
this might be the first time that a once gaming youtuber became a monk
the fact a guy who enthusiastically gets off on monetizing charity surpassed someone as humble as felix  is just pure insanity  what s wrong with people 
cannot believe both their first video was minecraft
i thought mr beast said he would delete his channel if he was going to pass pewdiepie 
dude happy wheels would have been lit
boring
infinite space and time  pew die pie is the meth lab of youtubers 
you will always be my number  1 youtuber on youtube
i know  man  now mr beast is in first place on having the most subscribers  he even have the ruby play button
book reviews are my fav type of videos 
you know a person started to understand nietzsche when they say  nietzsche is more of a slow cook 
if pewds was my philosophy teacher i would probably go to class
if pewds was any of my teachers i would go to class 
 dying is bad right  me with depression  ummmmmmmmmm
yoooooo ooooo ooooo
 pewdiepie 7 25 but if good and bad does not exist  what is virtue 
felix wants to collaborate with pewdiepie  finally an ending to the brutal rivalry
get this man past mr beast in subs
bookdiepie is my favorite of all time 
i wish pewdiepie would do videos where he talks about how to youtube works
s ubs
there may be channels that have more subs than you but you will always a be a youtube legend 
lol meanwhile where is pewdiepie s spirit
go back to let us play then
for any one windering  buddhism teaches people to follow a middle pathway of life  do not go extremely on the lower side and do not use anything nor to give up to your cravings and follow thr greed  it also shows that there are consequences to the things we do  things happen to us due to those things we do and are amplified by several other factors  buddhist believe in the concept of after life and see birth as the main source of suffering hence they try to achieve  nirvana  the state when one passes the chances of rebirth and the existence as a whole  this might not be the core but as a buddhist from birth that is how i can summorize the belief and my take on it 
not that i m sure he would see this but i wanted to suggest math books when i started the video and then i m pleasantly surprised that he did read one 
book review is such a good series
the fact that mrbeast tried to keep pewdiepie on 1  on the platform and failed and surpassed him is hillarious
he might have more subscribers  but ksi and pewdiepie will forever be the kings of youtube for sure
jimmy trying to keep pewds at number 1 then surpassing him himself is the perfect example of  you either die a hero  or live long enough to see yourself become the villain 
i mean he already predicted a long time ago
felix have you read blood meridian  i think you referenced it in one of your videos 
love you felic
going to unsub mr beast immediately
 pewds you should try reading quran  i am sure it will be an experience 
early 
   
i remember when mr beast helped to pewdiepie against tseries and now he reached it in sub 
felix  you are like aristote  the grea  one of the greatest youtuber  oufff
the student became the new sensei
plz help nature he get help you are future 
i like my videos with less than 200 jump cuts thank you pewds
you will always be the king no matter what
what didn t you used to have 117 subs
student > master
s ubs
it is crazy that i have been watching mr beast since 7th grade when he had like 8k subs and now i am 20 and he is the biggest youtuber   
read quran felix 
someone please like my comment when mr beast comments in this video
lol  was just thinking of pewdiepiew how he did not make a video in a while  and here we are  book review
if you actually watched the vid throughout  you would understand that last part and what  mrbeast has to do 
happy wheels part 200
i love nietzsche the true  bermensch  helped me trough tough times  fuck the nazis for misusing his words 
wow  mr beast is on fire  the crown of king of youtube could not go to someone more deserving though 
 we all going to live  we all going to die   what we do in between  we watch pewdiepie   pewds2022
thank you for tending to our psyche with these books felix  definitely going to be checking out nicomachean ethics now   but i feel you  nietzsche really is one of the best skeptics i ve ever read  nothing gets through to that man lol
i bet if pewd play minecraft he will beat mrbeast subscribe
yo what the fuck how come all these youtubers uploading same time is it the rapture
wowowowow
i absolutely and unironically despise mr beast  based entirely on his face 
wow it s crazy to think 7 years ago i never thought this day would ever even come
pewds has truely transcended youtube  he has transcended subscribers  he is on another level we cannot comprehend 
your number one in my heart for ever no matter what
i am suffering
mc because bs lora tau hay
this was the best bait  book review now 
    it s crazy how much he looks up to you too  two of my favorite youtubers 
mr beast is exploding more things in a single video like nothing can excite him anymore and i am here laughing my ass off by this funny ass humoristic book review 
what a time to be alive  i remember when the idea of passing pewdiepie was  literally a joke  like completely out of the question  do to how far ahead he was of everyone
still nr 1 independent youtuber by a longshot
that video was awesome  you are still the number one  person  on youtube even if your channel is not anymore  long live the king 
why is  person  written in quotation marks  lol
 kunilsen2519 truly disgusting that some  people  would do such a thing
 kunilsen2519 to emphasize that he  as an individual  has gotten this far as opposed to the teams of multiple people surpassing him in subscribers  i guess besides his editor editors hes just one person 
 kunilsen2519 because mr beast  cocomelon and t series are more like company s than individual people
 charlieb4617  aaah  that makes much more sense  i did not connect the dots and thought you were implying that pewds was not a normal person if one at all  and therefore the quotation marks lol
 mrnobodymny yes  truly disgusting that some  people  would do such a thing
no way mrbeast actually goes through with it 
happy wheels 200 
pewds is such an intp
are you going to return to minecraft
you still the king my guy   
love you
i thought he did years ago   
yet you still watchin his video goofy  
you had the throne for like 15 years   that is good enough    
can we all just seriously take a moment to agree that this is the perfect example of  a student surpassing the teacher  and also really very glad that they keep respecting each other so much 
  nah
cannot believe pewds lost his crown 3 times  hope you someday get the title of the most subbed youtuber again 
hi
they both start over and we all  
book review finally returns
pewds is on self improvment  nice soon the world will be less degenerate
yes  pewdiepie and felix collaboration needed  
lbozo
i invite you to islam  pewds 
pewdiepie pulled his uno reverse lmaoo  
i think we need wewe dielive shirts
no we cannot let this happen 
it is okay felix  you will love on in the hearts of many viewers  not mine  but many viewers 
rip
dear felix as far as i know you are pretty much a one person operation with some camera help from your wife from time to time  mr  beast released a collab video a few days ago that had a budget of  2 million you s  31 dslrs and gopro cameras  approx  seven on screen helpers  maybe eight editors who spent 16 hours to make a short video and it will be translated into between 8 10 different languages before posting  i am going to you have no equal on youtube and this is from a 63 year old canadian who is merely a fan and not a fanatic lol 
hello please reply to comment  
stoicism is just gloryfied depression
read subahibi
f
thanks for all the books that you share with us pewdiepie
book review back at a perfect time i just finished my last book i was reading
the day has come their is a new king i love mr beast but to be honest the true goat will be you pewd i watched you since 2012
when pewdiepie searched for aristotles wife i remebered that one painting  where his wife were rideing on him 
24 hours to delete your channel now go 
finally another book review  
happy wheels 200
this was so great   enjoyed it a lot   how far we have come  
pewds i would like for you to read some horror books  i just need recommendations on horror books lol  if anyone wants to give me some pls comment
pewdiepie jumping on the booktok trend  lol
jimmy s been real quiet since this video came out ooo
i love how jimmy went from pewds  protector to surpassing him 
why do i like to make myself suffer
 
my man click baited his cominity in to book reviev
mr beast should delete his channel and then immediately make a new one  to honour his word
sad
what pop filter is he using on the mic 
nature is the default way  not the true way 
talk bout books in the comments ffs  
did you know  men have less ribs then women     the book is kjv  please read thank youuuuuuu
at least i feel that i have more knowledge by watching this video rather than mrbeast video
good lord he is high
hahaha mrbeast is the best
where s my happy wheels 
pewds you have definitely inspired me since the last book review i read the iliad and plato s the republic and it is is super fascinating  and now i m trying to learn about all the great thinkers
mr beast vs t series 
i hope one day this channel will become  a science channel and invites all kinds of amazing scientists and scince celebrities   to talk with them on all the different aspects of science   scince and logic are underrated 
that tree  i recognize that tree  that is elvenar  decent mobile game i am going to
well adjusted intelligent independent thniker right here  keep teaching your followers 
10 43 yes pewdiepie haha you and me and probably others  i totally get what you are saying  i also want to know less of the world and life cuz it can ba lil too much for me sometime 
 but can you do this  is now 5 years old
i know 118 ml do not  worry pew die pie we all love your videos you will pass him
the fact that you are the first to reach 100 million subscribers is already something to be proud of  mr beast surpassing you is like giving out the torch to the next generation  truly a moment to behold 
he is too wise to care much respect to you mr pewds  brofist 
good book
mr beast diss track 
ja s  g r det n r man blir tr kig  p  p  p  p
mate you do not need anymore you are rolling in money
i do not know what changed but to me it feels like you are reverting back to the personality you put on a long time ago  just two months ago your content was calm  interesting and funny to watch  now the content ideas are still very interesting but with all the different voices it makes it harder to watch  this is just my opinion though so do what you find enjoyable
he passed you subs  but you are still the best youtuber in my eyes  i grew tired of his generic videos ages ago 
boooooook review let us gooooo  do not mind me i am crying because i want more happy wheels and amnesia mods   
it had to happen but do not let that tarnish what you did on youtube  you are an amazing youtuber no matter what the sub
mrbeast is already at 118 mil 
he is a beast  pewds does not care though we already lost to t series years ago
memento mori
first 
yo pewds became like me   
coco melon
i respect mrbeast s grind  but i do not know how long he can sustain that level of production quality without burning himself out  if i were in his position i would probably die of exhaustion 
why you uploading at midnight felix 
yes commander  i will do as you order commander  i will not sleeponepictitus 
read the quran
my favorite of your videos
is not partly a reason why you do not care about subs  becasue your already set for 100 lives  if you still needed to make videos to maintain an income i am sure you would care a little about subs 
mr beast has 118m subscribers 
i knew he was going to make a video that mr beast gained him more subscribers
it had to happen but do not let that tarnish what you did on youtube  you are an amazing youtuber no matter what the sub
epic
i want happy wheels
that was quite a twist that this whole video was felix and not pewdiepie 
go cry in a corner
i know it s over done but a distract on mr beast would probably be the best one  mr beast wouldn t be a baby about it like the other two   it would have been a great passing of the torch to give him a diss track
will mr  beast do it  find out in the next episode of book review
i thought he said meme review  
when i started watching felix he was my bro  now he is like my dad passing me his wisdom 
vids like these are so great sometimes and i hope happywheels is still on the table
n r skal du lese origin of species  dude  du m   det er basicly mandatory
finally book review
he s a true scorpio no fear of death
 pewdiepie please read the brothers karamazov by fyodor dostoevsky
so many comments stolen by bots
i mean not weird he passed you  do not think you realy trying to create new content  you kind of just post random stuff you enjoy and all power to you  but will not attract people as much  p
philosophy do be kind of sus though  we have not learned anything in 2000 years  those guys are still the masters  cringe 
so  i should put all my life investments on roulette  cuz it does not matter 
it had to happen but do not let that tarnish what you did on youtube  you are an amazing youtuber no matter what the sub
if happy wheels series comes back  it guarantee that the pdp channel gets to 200 million subs
l   l
he did it  he definitely did it  congrats mr beast  floor gang 
hacks
let us gooooooo
 dying is part of nature you crybaby 
coming back to watch pewds after a couple years and it feels like nothings changed lmao  feel right at home
no we need another hate track
look dude i have 1 2k and i am happy
just saying if you want to get a lot of subs just do a minecraft server
you are a legend    
noice
happy wheels part 200  
thanks for the book recoms dude
pewdiepie is king of youtube no matter what
the most underrated series on this channel 
relativism bad
i love these videos
review on three body problem 
it is the new youtube where corporations rule and you can buy yourself to the top as long as you have enough money or connections  not going to lie  i feel kind of bad for this generation 
congrats  i do not think you are as shallow as i once did   l 
this video is going to make pewdiepie blow up 
bring back minecraft
my new philosophy  wewedielive 
this is a perfect example of  the student surpassing the teacher 
r i p
ngl  this is actually a nice book review  makes me really want to buy these books too like a modern take on philosophy with words i can relate to lmao
one like please  
when the world needed book review the most  it returned
i respect you for discussing self improvement and philosophy to your audience
best comment ever 
also i hear christmas in japan is kind of funky 
mrbeast owns you now lil bro
do not worry my friend we are growing up 
when the world needed book review the most  it returned
you might lost the crown to youtube but you still have the crown in my favorite youtubers
ggs  glad ya ll respect each other  no heat 
let us gooooooo book review
i am sure we all want  congratulations   mrbeast edition 
 wewe dielive  i feel like my life has changed to the better already
this is a perfect example of  the student surpassing the teacher 
i got a notification saying  mr beast passed  scared the shit out of me until i opened the full notification
i m okay with mr beast being the one to take over as he isn t a massive corporate entity with every song in bollywood 
damn most of these subs are just not watching pewds anymore that sucks
i have been living in that kind of mindset of these philosophies for years  without knowing  but its so interesting to study and almost learn more about myself or what i can do to improve  like a good mirror
when the world needed book review the most  it returned
thank you for recomand buddishem becouse i think it is the best way to explain our life
ok pewds
i remember when i was a kid thinking pewdiepie getting passed in subs would be the end of the world
man s talking about self control and the benefits  meanwhile i m on a 6 hr yt hole with no end in sight
you re falling off pewdiepie  you re     dying 
felix 
it was fun while it lasted  ggs to mrbeast  may he live on to be the most subscribed individual creator on yt 
my best mr beast   
in south korea they actually read and learn the torah in schools because they admire how intelligent and smart jews are and want to learn from judaism  
wewe dielive   buddhism
0 29 well i do
as a long time viewer of mrbeast  there was one time he said he would delete his channel if he ever passed pewdiepie in subs  i think it was around the tseries time
felix talking about being surpassed in views and then making a book review with strong philosophy elements makes me feel so happy   he mentioned before that he really enjoyed making the philosophy video on nihilism but the video didn t do well  the same for book reviews   this is goddamn character development  thank you felix
read quran too
pewds will you read the holy quran  
t series did it first
hey when are you going to hit 112 million subs
you legend
grats 
3 43 bro  nooo xd
i think it s obvious why mr beast surpassed you in subscribers he is in fortnite 
even mr beast surpassed him still he is the teacher 
you do not get the views like the king of youtube
he deserves it more than you pewds  you have become lazy  but thank you for entertaining me for years  your minecraft series will always remain legendary 
pewds is the real og youtuber that everyone sees is legit mr beast is laundering money using youtube and is extremely fake  with fake friends and cringe content 
he passed you ages ago he is got something like 300 million total over all his channels
can i sing carolling to you 
mr beast my have shot to the top  but felix dedicated his life to this to get to where he is 
ah man  i love this pewds has grown over the years and the beauty about it  is that we love all of the content   
yea
we want pew newssssss
pewds you so wise 
if you played video games again you d still be  1  
get a kid bro
i just unsubscribed because i realised that you are searching for things to fill a void in your heart or to find meaning in life rather than to find a place for your soul  i pray that you will be saved one day  here is my last brofist 
 life is hard to bear  but then do not carry on so tenderly  we are all of us handsome  load bearing jack  and jillasses  what have we in common with the rosebud that trembles because a drop of dew lies on its body  it is true  we love life not because we are accustomed to life but because we are accustomed to love  there is always some madness in love  but there is also always some reason in madness    nietzsche  on thus spoke zarathustra  i too thought nietzsche was a bringer of nothingness and death  but nothingness and death were actually what he was trying to destroy 
noticed this yesterday and was wondering when one of them was going to bring it up  lol 
challenge him to a match in thunderdome  two men enter  one man leave 
pewdiepie he should discover irvin yalom i think he will find his book  very useful
clickbait  not again
glad to see felix featuring the underrated philosopher pewdiepie  i hope you two do a collab
did not he pass him like a month ago 
i still haven t subbed to any of beast s channels   sometimes i m a rebel that refuses to follow the crowds 
<3
              
why do not you give reading quran and hadith a go  it is interesting and there is a lot of philosophy in them 
but does mr beast do book reviews 
when the world needed book review the most  it returned
we should all appreciate the journey that felix has gone on and the impact he is made in the youtube world  no matter what his sub count is 
still waiting for happy wheels part 201  and for you to finish dark souls 3 
love you pewds  been watching since i was 21 now i am in my 30 s and have a kid  i love your book reviews  it feels like we kind of grew up together  and thanks for the rec on reading about buddhism because i was interested 
i love that felix is broadening his worldly perspective by learning philosophy  he should start a newsletter or something  because this is really interesting
    you re my favourite youtuber
he s got his own philosophy book  at the end of vid
diss track
some see it as  we die  and  we live  but i saw   we we dielive 
i really appriciate the editing in these videos  it really makes the content easier to understand
milan kundera  the unbearable darkness of light talks about the concept of eternal return  a good read i would say 
glad to have book review back  got into stoicism after seeing pewds videos about it and been practicing it after going through tough times in life   thank you pewds for this life inspiring content 
there may come a time in the career of every sociologist when it is his solemn duty to raise hell 
  what should i say  i am part of it but not that much of a religion person
 i don t personally subscribe to this idea    pewdiepie
i hoped it was happy wheels part 200
at least let s not forget he spent a lot to make pewds the first 100m subscriber but unfortunately lost to t
why is this comment section so cringe
as pewds said  he has already  retired  from youtube so it makes sense he does not care about his subs anymore
to be fair  mr beast probably puts a craaazy amount of work into making yt videos  whereas pewds has for a long time not cared about growth and just puts out videos when he feels like it  about what he wants  the fact that it took this long for mr beast to pass his subscriber count is crazy 
thanks  pewds  i got no idea about english  but after watching a couple of your philosophical videos  i m now fluent in taiwanese  greetings from colombia 
mrbeast crushed pewdiepie 
that is what dr  phil does to people
let us hope pewdiepie be on mrbeast challenge in the future 
mr pie great content 
pewds missed the perfect opportunity to include  this book loves you 
one mastered the youtube algorithm   the other wrote it 
 you and mr beast  make my life better with your content       
i do not care  mrbeasts uses the new yt feature that cannot be turned off where everytime you click on his video it will be voiced in whatever language your country speaks and i absolutely hate it
when the world needed book review the most  it returned    
 i have taught you all now you shall pass me and teach the things who needs help 
he deserves it
it is time to go 
how did you skip  the power of now 
mr beast diss track
might i suggest osho  the diamond sutra  the buddha also said   i know the author is controversial  but it is truly the best explanation and understandable clarity of the philosophy of buddhism 
waiting for a distrack
 the editing in this was      
wow i am early
good video
always love the book vids  thank you pewds 
this is a perfect example of  the student surpassing the master 
its because you do not give away lots of money to people 
the new era is upon us old man  step aside
we are all going to live we are all going to die what is in between watch pewdiepie wow it rhymes
ha ha
interesting that book reviews are getting reccomended in the side like damn that is some algorithm sway i do not look at book reviews and afaik this is not even directly tagged as book review
i never read very often but if i do it is usually just fantasy or autobiographies 
s ubs
look up dr steven greer he is modern day philosopher
someone is jelly  hehe seriously  it is great to see your book review 
you should read the cyropedia 
if a man is the same in his 40 as he was in his 20 he has waisted 20 years  do not be ashamed or anything books are very cool too
mr beast is far better then this weirdo of course he got more subs lmao 
is it me or does his hair color change every video
this video is great    i declare
mr beast < pewdiepie
lmao are we going to start another sub war like with t series 
nmw pewds is still the king of youtube  all hail the king  
now 118million
it is quite ironic how the person who helped greatly in the t series sub war is the first solo youtuber to surpass felix  and i honestly do not think anyone including felix could think of  a better person to overtake the  1 spot 
so it finally happened 
nothing lasts forevrr
we need happy wheels part 200 plz
pewds is still the best for me pewds grow his channel by himself  other channel have videographer  editor  assistant and other stuff
felix  even though jimmy has passed you in subscribers  you will always be the goat of youtube  much love and thank you for always making me laugh  
we are all happy that pewdiepie doesn t care
somebody just told me that  mr beast passed him  i knew it hes going to say he does not care anymore but bruh  we know who is the legend  the pro   the myth  the original ytber who went 100m subs alone  fricking aloone 
read  bhagavad gita  highly recommended
clickbait
pwedypir
pewds you are about to lose more subs with this   save yourself by narrating each good for us
i mean pewdiepie will not care because he has achieved his major life goal moving to japan
love the content as alway <3
pewds for his 1st book basically said  choco pizza is the best pizza  and pizza is better than burgers agree agree
i am so sorry but i read the title as mr breast
i appreciate the recommendations pewds  i will try to make it my new years resolution to read some of the books you talked about  that is said  i would love your recommendations to get into philosophy  i am not sure if some of these are too advanced for me to start with
that happened   
felix  for the love of all that is holy in the world  pop that absolute chad of a pimple  and better yet  film it 
a few more books like that and felix is going to turn into jordan peterson  
i wonder if he has read the quran
its just ok 
bae wake up  pewds dropped a new book review
 the student has become the master 
it s a bit random  but you look a kind of skinny  are you eating enough  
 
happiness is being a dane
same like kong vs godzilla   
everything good must come to an end   it hates to see but that is life
new reading sets for the new year  thank you pewds          
mrbeast shaking where he stands  pewds about to catch up after his book review series
hi 
book suggestion  read bhagwad gita
wow
wow  nice clock
   
time to stream genshin impact 
its a shame it had to happen  and i hope you guys do not break up  but to be honest he passed you a while ago by making language dub channels  my mans is at like 200m subs right now hahaha
is just 4m you can get more
if you wanted to do happy wheels do happy wheels  i will smash like on that 
mr beast is the lowpoint of judentube 
you will always be  1 in my book
mr  beast passes pewdiepie  mr  beast  i became the very thing i swore to destroy
once a student is now the teacher
the student becomes the master
mr beast is his friend
you will always be  1 to us felix
i have watched you since fucking 2011 when i was just a kid on the studsmatta  i love these kinds of videos  personally i recommend beyond good and evil by nietzsche  i can understand how people can see his lessons as dangerous when applied to certain people   but i do believe that reading this with that in mind  and a teaspoon of salt  you can really gain some perspective on life  aaaaaand you mention it later in the video  fuck 
thank you so much  i did not know i need this today  i defeintely will read some of your recommendations
this guy is not  
we will see if every other youtubers do book reviews 
 do not go on instagram   me watching instagram while watching this video  gulps 
i need happy wheels part 200
s ubs
you finally made a video about it 
sub urban  
not going to lie  happy wheels 200 would as the kid say   slap 
huh  did not expect that 
someone who once called you lord  king  master  is now the lord  king and master 
asd
collab 
stupid video
so now mr beast has to delete his channel 
of course the new generation always surpasses the old one but pewds will always remain the king of youtube 
             
time really flies by   it has been a surreal journey till now felix
i would love to hear what pewds thinks about st augustine s confessions 
 if you have fear of loosing what you have  then you are ultimately beeing controlled by it   pewdiepie 6 59
didn t watch pewds in a year  damn he buddhist now
10 23 i am guilty of doing this all the time lol
greatness is not comes from number of your followers  it is what person you are and what message do you spread  wtf mr beast does except entertaining  pewds enlights us and want us to be better  for that i will forever be grateful
 
i cannot subscribe any harder  pewds 
 live life good  do not live forever bad   buddhistsm
i don t get how people can consume mr  beast content
1k reply likes    
i love this
i would watch pewdiepie all day but i ran out long ago
thank you man  i m so happy for you
at this rate mr beast might be the first 200 million subcriber if he keep doing this  keep up the good content there pewds 
that is a retired warrior damn  by the way good books  and visit india sometime
pewdiepie is still a goat
where s meme review
you should read the writings of thomas aquinas
pewds  do the right thing pewds  there is no good or bad me  confused pikachu face
noooooooo  happy wheeeeeels part 200  > infinity  
r i p  pewds  you had a great run  continue to make fantastic content 
mr beast and cardi b owned you
so buddhism is just hinduism lite 
pewdiepie   cr7
new mrbeast video  my 118million subscribers vs 111million pewdiepie subscribers
want more  subs   2 words   mind craft 
people die when they are killed
congrats beast 
t series and coco overtake pewds  disstracks that become meme classics mrbeast overtake  peace is the true option
i loved this book review  the way he explained each book got me interested in reading them 
i highly recommend to you works by khalil gibran  i believe you d find his thoughts interesting 
omg happy wheels part 200 lololol
hi pewdiepie
i got to be honest here  this is actually by far the best pewdiepie video i have ever seen  great recommendations  thanks pewds 
we are getting old man
okay  but these are very good actually  alright i will bite and read them
mr beast been really quit since this video came out
this was actually helpful
you need to try the quran
vote my community
at last lessgo
i am going to need a literal passing of the torch 
i love hearing about his opinions on nietzsche  but now i want to know how pewds feels about arthur schopenhauer  great book review 10 10
two minutes in   this vegetarian is craving a whopper 
the video you are making  the videos you are creating  your hard work still stays  your channel is better and perfect  the teachings are spiritual
book review videos will always be a gem for me 
no matter what happens  pewds will always b a legend
i expected a song 
i was here before mrbeast comments
ayooooooogh
i think we all know that another happy wheels video would shoot his channel way past maybe even t series
hello pewds  i think you should get into islamic sufism  it talks about how to control yourself in a religious framework  i promise you would like it
no way  that s amazing  the student truly has surpassed the teacher
don t worry pewds
it is interesting how many versions of buddhists scriptures were made after the pali canon
these book reviews got me into the channel  weird right  well i love them
mr beast the overrated clickbaiter obviously botted alot of subs
pewds is now my favourite philosopher  we have really come a long way
holy sh t did not expect that  last time i checked mr beast s subs do not remember when  he had 53m subs
pewdiepie will get 6 million subs after this
pewds is the grandfather of youtube
muaaahhhh 
buddhism is satanic
hold on  did not mrbeast say he would delete his channel when he passes you in subscribers 
epictetus
sad times   but congratulations mrbeast   
clickbait 
this is a historical event
sub 
so funny that i am born in nepal
i want to see felix collab with pewdiepie 
the thing is  mrbeast buys his fame by giving away money in return of subs  its a fake youtuber   your doing good felix  well done atleast you do not buy people like he does
huh now i may go back and try and read my copy of beyond good and evil
i am actually taking down notes 
mr  beast ain t got nothing on book review
i do miss the more serious tone you had in your previous book reviews but regardless glad book review is back
cannot believe felix also reads pewdiepie s book  literally one of the best piece of literature ever written 
all of buddhas teachings have repitition dude literally repeadtly asked himself questions and came to enlightenment of repeated answers to different situation
rude af
has he ever read marx s capital 
 or to be that one person that talks about the double slit experiment  stop talking about me  man  <
6 45 but i thought you did not had any legs
not the s ubs 
defeated but not lost
congratulations to mrbeast  if anyone deserves this  it is him 
s ubs
book review is back baby that is what i have been waiting for woooooo
time to grind those subs back  pewdiepie 
thank you mr  felix my brain is full now
cmon pewds  i want 14 minutes 12 too small and stinky number  14 minutes more floor gang ough
congratulaton mr beast
pewds   mr beast passed me in subscribers  here is how i deal with that 
dang i wanted another distrack
cuando era ni a veia imposible que alguien superara a este wey xd
xd pues a pewdiepie no han superado en 10 a os casi xd
mrbeast has already pass you long time by 100 million 
yeeessssss
to be fair pewdiepie blew up when youtube was like 10x as big
pewdiepie has the most epic youtuber character arc i have ever seen  from amnesia to book review this guy is an absolute legend
you should have done happy wheels part 200
i have declared 
than i am the happiest person in the world
if you want the best book on philosophy and true wisdom  read the book of proverbs in the holy bible     actually  just read the whole bible
 mr beast passed me in s ubs  great english
enjoying your life is way better than growing subscribers 
i remember the day pewds passed smosh  i feel so old now
its time for a diss track 
i do not have enough money for buying these books
w
lol sir pewdie pie  watching here sir  happy holidays
you should do a dis track but actually just compliment mr beast for the whole video 
still waiting for happy wheels
wergsd dog is a great day of my favorite 
can you please read seerah of muhammad  it much better than these books  the word seerah means a path one takes from one place to another  a path a person takes during his her lifetime  it includes attitudes and behavior 
i not surprised mr beast passed in subscribers  he is like the yt king 
who would like to see him playing happy wheels like the good old days
people   mr beast has passed pewdiepie in subs  what do we do  pewdiepie   book xd
being poppia gloria back
definitely not a 12 min ad for his book    
how to read books without reading books
it would be funny if we all just unsubscribe
pewds  i do not care   5 min later  this was the moment pewdiepie came back full time  
i have been waiting for this video for soo long  god dang i was tired of searching for a new book  now i can finally figure it out 
should have done happy wheels
9 28 ahaahaaaa  he truly  got over it  now  
respect
just open a shitty burger chain
pewds still the king
w8 12 minutes ago 
he s just realized this 
sabine said that alternate universe multiverse theory is not science
rip slippy  today marks the passing of the legendary amphibian 
 
ah yes  the secret weapon of the brofist 
i love the thumbnail lmao
wait felix has legs 
no joke i do not actually know who mr beast is or what he does
 do not take my legs  wait  you have legs   
you will always be on top on our hearts no matter how far you fall
kind of weird pfp
because its a bot
 kungerik it is a bot
 dorido5454 these porn bots are getting kind of spooky  scrolling down the comments  i almost do not even realize they are bots at first 
 kungerik it is a porn bot 
 thegreenknight500 just look at the pfp and you will know
money bought pewdiepie enlightenment
very nice  now let us see marzia s book collection
dude just declare war on mr beast   i am sure you can win that  and kick him out of yt rewind
s ubs lol
who the fuck even watches mr beast  you cannot tell me his viewers are not npc s  
relax guys he uses internet explorer
this is a sub par comment  
you should have done happy wheels part 200
pewdiepie always make funny videos for us and entertain us
isn t it a relief   deep down you wanted this to happen   
wtf
you should make music video giving the crown to mr beast the new youtube king
pewdz very emergency    if pass beast mr must bring back beast masta 64   thank you japan man see beast man soon
oml
even after all these years of being subbed   watching pewds  it is a bittersweet feeling seeing him surpassed  he will always be  1 in my heart
the antichrist by nietzsche is good too
damn the framerate though
 
you both are op
i do not have the wealth to be as satisfied as felix pewds  i am stuck doing regular life job things  thanks for the review though bruh   
if there is no craving desire in life then what would be the point of living  i mean we technically do  crave  happiness or  crave  living in the moment right 
this is one of a scene in the history of youtube 
who tf are you 
are you serious  bro he was the most famous youtuber in the world until a few weeks ago or just a week ago i do not remember
internet explorer told pewdiepie that mrbeast passed him 
have you read quran kareem  felix 
this inspired me a lot to be a better person  still as good as always pewds
book review     
w
        
dang he surpassed you in  s ubs  i cannot believe he has more  s ubs  instead of subs 
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
i love how pewds turned a possible rage filled joke video into a lovely nice book review  
there s no competition here  mrb is a walking trending page by luck  anyone can do what he does    i give a million dollars after taking a soda bath challenge   garbage  pewds on the other hand should trend everyday but hardly does 
you live and you die  what do you do in that time  watch pewdiepie 
siuu
subscribe
as a south asian buddhist i am impressed at how well he has understood buddhism  usually white people that are into buddhism really do not know what they are talking about 
i love how you can see the differences in generations between you guys  with felix you still get that old school  you  tube feeling  whereas with jimmy you see the new generation  extravagance  style of youtube 
pewdiepie chooses what videos he makes for the youtube algorithm  the youtube algorithm chooses what videos mrbeast makes 
this is terrible news  i would much rather hear the words  jiggy jiggy  spoken by a middle aged overweight woman telling the world about her sexual desires towards a 20 years younger tunisian man  repeatedly  than hear about mr beast s sub numbers overtaking pewdiepie s 
read the quran  do not miss it 
book review is back baby
day 5 of me asking pewds to stream again
to be honest  it is too decisive to choose which youtube content creator is better  either pewdiepie or mrbeast  but both of them make great content
wtf there is a 4 min unskipable ad f you dr squash omg 1 2
you will always be the kind of youtube
cannot believe that this is the same guy who used to scream the word barrels every five seconds
i just think its both surreal and awesome cuz mrbeast really admired and was a huge fan of pewds back in the day  welp mrbeast deserves it anyway
mr beast puts out crazy good content and your boring most the time no offense   just do something big to get us to click
yo  when did pews get so good looking 
the king has fallen gracefully
i was about to post  awful taste unsubscribed and subscribed to mr  breast  until you pulled out the gay science 
 control your anger   kratos
he may have technically passed you  but you retired on top  
                                                                                                                                                                
pewds should be a therapist more often   i love this   been here since the very beginning   and these vids still hit me in the throat 
i subbed again with the return of book review
philosophy phridays got me like  
all hail mrbeast  the supreme leader of youtube 
 he still the number one in our hearts 
lone youtuber > team of youtubers
its funny the comments are all about the thumbnail  not the actual content
what about gay science 
be desireless 
what an absolute betrayal lol
if he beats you in subs  beat him in abs
your the best forever
thanks for the good content
we all knew this day would come 
to growth subscribers start give away content
try the  holy quran  for your answer 
pewdiepie will always be nr 1   
pewds still the youtube god
he sucks
pewdiepie is king
                              
read the quran 
i unsuited from mr beast a few weeks ago  just realized i never watch his stuff so why stay subbed 
buddha boken har jag s tt p  det svenska vipassana centret  du borde testa en 10 dagars vipassana kurs  dom finns i japan ox 
time for a diss pewds  beast lasagna  lmao jk but i still bump all your songs to this day and also go by t series channel to tell them to ligma balls
it really shouldn t even matter even if pewds cared because jimmy was supposed to be part of 9 year old army
watching you since 2010 s still got that humour i love  
you should read supermega saves the troops
good boks 
but he will not pass you as in being a actual you tuber  mr beast is a corporation
you are still  1 to us
3 32 the greatest is obviously jaden smith 6 44 he does not have any  they already took them
when the world needs him he must leave right now
as a sri lankan  i am soo happy to know our 9yr old king understand the true meaning of buddhism towards the normal ordinary life more than lots of present sri lankans  
but a sailboat

in 11minutes 1 1k comments
no matter when channel is not growing faster  but you will always be the king of the youtube  he does not care about the subscribers  that is the right decision   your channel is never dying
i find your content far more palatable
difference between the way you explained buddhism with stoicism 
11 56 damn that is a crazy challenge lol
damn  that was my most expected video from pewds
awesome video these will definitely go on my book list
do a review of the quran felix 
nooo
when the world needs him he must return right now when the world needs him he must leave right now
i hope mrbeast will comment in this video 
pewdiepie is the king of youtubes past  mrbeast is the king of youtubes present
nothing can take away or change what you done during the golden age of youtube  king     and we will never forget it
deez
we need pew news 
how tf did mrbeast do that
i am kind of pissed that so many people are arguing over mrbeast or pewdipie  who is the best or who is the king  like  they both reached insane heights and they both have created amazing content  cannot people just enjoy the fact that these two creators are successful  one being in retirement  whilst one is rapidly growing  their contribution to this platform is something that will not be forgotten 
why are you so desperate for likes that you make shit up like that  there is definitely not  so many people  that do that  and most of those people are just going against jimmy  most people are being respectful and chill about it 
sane human moment
and pewdiepie have litterly said over 10 times that if anyone deserves the  1 spot  its mrbeast 
i don t even feel like their content has hardly anything in common  
you clearly do not watch football  or any kind of sports  if this is a first for you 
 dkf oli exactly  that is why it does not make sense to compare
 user zq2hb6ci7m did you manage to get 900k  views by leaving stupid comments like this 
my name
not to mention  mr beast has also done alot to support pewds
yea
    are you inspired by dillonthehacker 
mr beast disstrack incoming 
we are with you   
you should have done happy wheels part 200
where is the mrbeast disstrack 
good or bad news  he deserves it  pewds is more of an enthusiast that converted to business  mr beast is an enterpreneuer that converted business into entertainment 
you should read the qur an 
just read the quran bro
wewe dielive
epictetus   epic titties
wtf felix
pewds you will still forever be my swedish king 
time for mr beast to delete his channel
thanks for sharing 
 take control of your body  as i am literally spraying whipped cream into my mouth next to to open fridge lmfao
where is meme review 
screw your books about self control just admit it being second place being second best hurts like hell it hurts you to the point you want to ceize to exist admit it just admit it that way you will feel easier what you doing is suffering
sheet
pewdiepie s secret plan  hack the series and make it yours  and thus return to being the biggest youtuber in the world for another 12 years
 
e
long live the king
i just find it hilarious how much harder mr beast had to try to get 100 million subscribers  pewdiepie did not even need to try  he was just himself 
now jimmy needs to start an  unsubscribe mrbeast  campaign
pewdiepie will always be number 1 in our hearts regardless how many subscribers he has or whatever type of content he makes
loved the reference to homeless people vine 
lel
youtube is bigger than ever and mrbeast provides a specific type of content that is extremly popular as of recent  so it was obvious that he is going to take over at some point   pewds is still the true king  d  
when will you arrange lwiay
mrbeast son  pls      
you could read aurora  nietzsche   
whilst mrbeast set a standard of yt like no other person on the platform  felix will forever be the pinnacle of what was the best time of youtube   
pewds is still a small team and mr beast is big almost corporation i feel this is the same as the t series thing a few years back
you have cool videos  but you should make a change in your video
pewds reached 100m as solo and beast reached 100m as big team  its harder on your own but eveything is possible 
felix  these ooga booga words do not do these subjects justice  i highly suggest everyone check these books out for more context though 
i get felix his accomplished it all already so they is not much to care about
this is the man who skips cutscenes  by the way
i hope this channel never ends and keeps spreading happiness   
this is crazy
should ve done happy wheels  
you should try the muslim books
nan
lol
i never subscribe to mrbeast if he never stops offending his fans  
i read blood meridian and you never reviewed it 
both of you and mrbeast are legends
in the end   the student surpassed his teacher  
pewds transcendent us mere mortals with books
mr beast and pewdiepie is same to me   
pewdiepie is better than mrbeast
do you think pewdiepie will be back and play outlast 3  i miss the old days    
skill issue
 
sadge
when i am watching this i keep remembering about the meme reviews and the minecraft content this just made me low key sad
early to the video  
hewow
pewdiepie  my day gets way better watching your videos love your positivity and humble that you are  love your videos
you should read quran pewdiepie
pewds just posted this 4 minutes ago  where thumbnail says mr  beast has 112 m subs  but right now mr  beast now has 118 m subs lol 
but if you re craving happiness aren t you suffering in the end 
pewdiepie has been stuck on 111m subs for so long 
mr beast is better than pewdipie
i desperately want pewdiepie to review 12 rules for life   jordan peterson
sluta aldrig med det du g r
i love book reviews 
a book review is what we all needed right now
yess finally
just glad it s you two and not other annoying channels out there
instructions unclear have not eaten in days
pew go and visit cat island
felix its like 1 00 in japan let me sleep

happy wheels part 200
i do not know what to say but keep   shining

that thumbnail made me laugh harder than i should have
omg  i swear mr  beast was at 20 million
where is the rap
god got doll
imagine mrbeast watching this video
huh maybe its time to revisit your good friend the barrels and stephano
massive respect to the g o a t of youtube  you will always be the greatest youtuber that had inspired the likes of mrbeast 
pewdiepie and mrbeast are true kings of youtube  arguing which one is better is pointless  channels are different
book review  
undeserved 
isn t enchiridion an adventure time episode or something
pulling out the big guns  lol
pewds you will always be my favourite youtuber  i always watch your vids and they make my day  i just wanted you to thank you for helping me trough tough times
finnaly  book review  after watching your video  i am going to read harry potter  first able  i must read fantasy books and if i become expert  i might also read fiction books to get knowledge and self improvement 
i really missed book review
i ve been needing books like this after having my second baby  thanks for the upload  i needed it today 
it feels so good to be able to mature with felix  it seems like his content is catered towards me as the years go by and i age 
you are the best  felix  <3
 
diss track incoming
if mr beast passed pewdiepie  we will always remember that pewdiepie is always the true king  
book review
bro has turned mr beast beating him into a life lesson
felix  i read buddha s words also felix  addicted to gfuel
a mr beast x pewdiepie collab would go absolutely insane  
still i love you are work   
glad to see history being made
read bhagvat geeta
i think it was cicero who said   the wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection  he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures  or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains  anyway i love your more  intellectual  content and would love more  i am really interested in your philosophy and development because you seem to have it figured out and are on top of life  you got a lot of depth we do not see in your usual content  i think it is awesome that you care about this stuff and existentialism and expose so many of your viewers to these ideas which i believe are sorely needed 
the food of mind is reading books 
i m so happy that felix found out about buddha  buddhism prevents me from kms
mr beast is the new king
maybe if mr  beast continues getting more subs pewds will actually give us a happy wheels part 200  everyone sub to mr  beast lmao
long live pewdiepie
just play minecraft
atleast felix have exactly  111million  subs    
i am more than willing to watch pewdiepie for the whole day
feliz navidades felix and a happy monday 
pewds the philosopher  
i can watch anything he upload i guess
ya because your content has sucked for years brother
pewdie anagonye
he is now at 119
bad video
coool
like hihi
no matter what pewdiepie your still og 
pewdiepie will always be number one to me
cannot stop the inevitable  you had a great run felix  
i actually cannot believe mrbeast got more subscribers then pewdiepie  0
big l
read a bible nigga 
nice video pewdiepie and mrbeast
life is suffering
the new generations pewdiepie is mr beast
hi felix
1 month later  finally he made a video about this but now mrbeats is at 118 million lol
wow pewdiepie is still close to the community even when he is basically retired    the fact that he even uploads at 1am in japan is crazy 
well  mrbeast is just the face a voice nowadays  he has people doing everything else such planning videos  editors  staff etc   pewdiepie has an editor so technically he s the biggest youtuber   like if you agree
subs 
crazy to think about how far this channel has come and how much both pewds and his community have grown
his community is mostly in 20s now  i watched him since i was 11 and i am 21 now
 deezekii3479 same
when they go high  we go bigbrain  
i love pewdiepie he is for sure a part of my childhood its really weird seeing him with less subs then someone
history repeats itself
pls like me comment        
the crown has been passed respectfully  from one chad to another 
i love kitler
sigheil
i remember seeing a headline about mr  beast passing pewds up in subs before work one morning  and was actually sad  
both are   goats 
a worthy successor
super  
pewdiepie you passed mrbeast  please guys subscribe felix  i want that pewdiepie do not sad 
why did i think it is going to be a lwiay when i saw the thumbnail  
i think we need a series on religion then    am i right or not   
minecraft days are over  
its been 84 years
them early
pewds and mr beast collab
will end world hunger
beast and pewds are both great creators but i reckon if pewds made a conscious effort to gain subs he would take the roof off
you guys will always be equal in my book 
honestly i think i have grown with pewds  in 2016 i enjoyed the edgy frank style humor   and in almost 2023 i read books and enjoy a philosophical perspective  truly amazing 
        stop living
sheep
yea but wake up bro it is time for school
you enjoy philosophy  you say  name every philosopher 
        false
        stop the cap
 akbayer lmaooo i am sorryyyyy
great childhood  i think i subbed in his bom of 2012  the one people said they missed  i miss the nostalgia sometimes  but filthy frank pewds was funny af  chill pewds laying down some fire lyrics though  the perfect vid to being passed  merry christmas     
yea 
time to retire pewd
don t tease me with happy wheels pewds  
halo
you are always best   
tambi n t dobl  en el doblaje al espa old  a ve cuando haces el tuyo ya que no entiendo ni ver
so wait  if i am craving to watch pewdiepie i am suffering  noooo 
this is a big moment for someone who looked up to you and referenced you he has now passed you
do bible review
i already liked him before i knew he was the top youtuber  that is true fan bond
squeezie     for all the time in my heart
buddhism is just a nihilistic worldview hidden as a religion 
to my right are a group of peopel who asked
still the best christian channel ever
 
ok
 
christian  dude he is not religious
the people in this comment do not get the jokes 
 
crazy how i have been with pewds since 2012 and knew mrbeast since 30k subs   youtube will never be the same
according to the clock on the wall  it took felix 25 minutes to shoot this episode 
i am here early
the camera frame rate be like when i login on minecraft and there s like 80 mobs
      
aristotle   women have less teeth than men  well  my wife does 
i thought it just clickbait
i think pewdiepie jealous because mrbeast cross him in subs   
the consequences of saying the n word
i cannot believe it  i jumpedddddd
both pewds and jimmy will always be the kings of youtube  
anata ga sabusukuraib  ni hari tsuke rarete ite mo  shin no senshi wa ki ni shimasen

pewdiepie has no boundaries on how crazy his content gets and he never fails us to entertain us and he always makes our day or night even better
so 
bro how do i watch pewdiepie when i already watched all of his videos over 10 times already
ik that this like a good moving on moment from trying to get the most subs but  i miss trying to get more subs and being so happy passing every mark i m not ready yet i am about to just keep telling myself that mr beast channel is a mostly group chanel with a lot of people so technically pewdiepie is still number one person alone with most subs let me be happy  
never knew i would still be watching this crazy swedish dude react to things up to this day   love this guy
do not care you still the goat youtuber
can you just say hi 
hi  
mr beast always said   subscribe to pewdiepie  and now surpassed him   
sad
i have no complain this channel being a philosophical channel giving me existential crisis 
      
hi
you are still number one for us   
mrbeast is channel that is doing videos a lot of people  so it is like t series  it means pewdiepie is this number one youtuber
you are always  1 for us felix  
in every generation  a monarch is replaced by someone else  but they are never forgotten  neither was their status  therefore you will still be the king of youtube

floor gang
                                                         
bro s a month late in mentioning mr  beast surpassing him and is declaring shit like he s escanor from 7ds
if pewd want more sub maybe good time he should travel around world meet new people get him more attention to him man give this man big derserve  
remember when nigahiga was the king 
we going to have another t series situation goin on 
subscribers does not matter  we still love you  pewdiepie  brofist  
pewdiepieee    you will be always in our hearts  thanks pewds 
he is the chosen one  the one to beat t series 
you should ve done happy wheels part 200  
this is honestly really cool  like instead of all the basic youtube content we get this nice little break about books 
umm what does copium mean 
today  men  we witness history in the making 
mr beast passed you in ubs  wow
power of money 
bro has 111 million subscribers forever
war were declared 
i was born 3 days before you made this channel i did not know i was this close to a legend
bitch lasagna part 2 
under 30 minutes pass
i read blood meridian  i am now a changed man  maybe not for the better 
f
yessirrrrr
both way better than t series
mr beasts will eventually follow your footsteps and fight corporations
ill always be your bro pewdiepie   bro for life
well  at least you still shoot videos at will and support your channel  and us 
love you pewdiepie
s
wow
i came expecting a video about how to surpass the sub count again and he is just talking about books i absolutely love him
poor felix  
guys 12 min is not much  try to give it a shot  you might enjoy it 
i swear to god i ve been here since at least 3 mil i started watching pewdiepie roughly around the time seananners did his minecraft series  better times back then 
no matter who surpasses you  a king will always be a king bruh  love yaaaa    
boasting much 
deja vu i would feel this video release years ago 
it saids 1 view after 5 minutes
you have really out done jimmy now  a book review  how will he ever recover from this  
always bro  
ik you acted as mikhail baryshnikov in the erb
me noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
you and mr beast are you tube gods history will remember you both
pewds   stefano will always be number 1
first to witness this
i feel like mr beast s next video is going to be  deleting my youtube channel 
i mean i do not think he made this video becuz of mr beast  i think he did it just becuz he really wanted to review these books
1 book i recommend you read pewds is called  the 10 types of human  by  dexter dias  will really give you a perspective on the human mind
700 comments but 1 view    my app is tripping
yes  book review  yay 
who s that other guy 
baaah
mrbeast in 2018  subscribe to pewdiepie pewdiepie in 2022  subscribe to mrbeast
 its been years but he finally uploaded 
you will always be the king to me
mr beast is over than you with 7m subs  he is channel growing so fast
at least felix retired happy  finished minecraft  got married  and moved to japan  some youtubers did not even retire  they just disappeared away from controversies 
how are you watching a video that just came out on a guys channel that  retired  do you know what retiring means 
  beastness501 it is a matter of a shift in mindset  felix is uploading now because he wants to and still enjoys making content  rather than out of a sense of obligation that it is his job as a youtuber 
 beastness501 hes retired  hes doing it as a hobby now and not as a job 
pewdiepie is a racist
 filip9564 nah  he retired from the grind  but hes not  retired   his income still comes from youtube and his merch  he will truly retire when he quits uploading 
    caps is a way to do it   
now who s gunna beat that bitch lasagna t series 
halo good evening    nice video
do not worry about mrbeast passing you  most of his subs are probably just desperate people wanting money anyway
when will you read quran 
mrbeast owes me 1b  if he comments on this video
this was perfect
hi pewd s
pathetic 
change the thumbnail mr pew  beast is currently at 118 million not 112million  and and will also pass you soon 
next read   quran
mr beast finally beat you 
ok
pewds actually looks like he doesn t care about subs or the rat race anymore  he s just enjoying his life and graciously letting us experience sone part of it 
he s been this way for a while lol  even when the t series thing was happening he was doing it for a meme  he hasn t cared about subs for a long time
  
you still making bank anyway lol
mr beast watching this video
glad to see the book reviews r back 
mr beast is better than you  
atleast pewdiepie is original king
mr beast diss track when

h8
you will always be on top on our hearts no matter how far you fall
what do you mean fall  are you ok 
beautiful message
dude he definitely did not drop  just his subscribers are not active 
 sk8ordie548 i meant in ranking
 avimo2565 have you ever cared about his ranking 
   111m          118m
finally
subs 
you will still keep the crown of youtube  one day we shall march through them  take revenge on t series and take back youtube 
s ubs 
mr beast distrack when 
honestly
hi
book review is far better than happy wheels
the space in subs  
am here for your content it is fun and chilly  you are the real  king of youtube
to be fair  most of his subscribers are people just hoping to get freebies out of him  it is what he is known most for  you are known for gaming and now just being a social commentary guy  it was going to happen anyhow  he just cashed in where you did not and it is what it is 
pewdiepie has made millions of subs by simply being himself  eventually someone else who does thousands of give aways and bribes will surpass him
hi
this was predicted
bruh bought the subs
atleast you were the king of youtube and you are still one of the most subscribed youtubers
okay
 i view  111m subscribers  makes sense to me 
o7
rip pewds the former king  
second
pewdiepie still my fav  
eeey
hi
burger
both pewdiepie and mrbeast are the best youtubers ever
i am 3st
mrbeast must be laughing in a corner after watching this  
whoever s reading this  i pray that whatever your going s through gets better and whatever you re struggling with or worrying bout is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day  amen
keep on moving 
it does not matter if he passed you in subs  both are legends
f

so when mr beast diss track coming 
yooo
title mistake gang
who even cares  really 
strong strong video
why not reading book while playing happy wheel 
ok
you are still the king
pewdiepie when mr  beast passes him   mr  beeeeeeeeeaast 
always one of the goats  you walked so everyone else can run   
as much as i appreciate mr beast  despite not personally liking his content  his channel is what i d consider an organisation  pewdiepie all but built his channel entirely on his own  while mr beast saw his subscribers grow when he formed a team and expanded his staff into the dozens  i still consider pewdiepie to be the single most subscribed youtuber on the platform 
yay
your e legend of youtube
finally he addressed it 
r i p
  from terrorism has no religion  to peaceful community teaching it  we all grew up
kwaahhhhh
damn
felix and marzia will always be the king and queen of youtube no matter what 
when the world needed book review the most  it returned
the king has been dethroned
from strangers to friends  friends into lovers  lovers into enemies
to be fair  your sub growth has been very slow and low view count
love your videos

sheehs

legend did not wanted to pass him in likes on a video back then and now he passed him in subs  
first
no matter what happen you will alway be number 1 youtuber to us bro s pewds  
ok
i love felix
congrats to mr  beast
holy shit i am early as f
ah yes  the book review  the excalibur of content
bruh
honestly the humblest man i ve never met
you met him 
 mr hazard6398never met
 yeaman ok
tell that to t series xd
10 years ago  i would never have thought of pewdiepie as a wise introspective fan of classical philosophy  he is taken all the good and bad of his career and really learned something from it 
t series laughing at this
you have met quite a few people then 
 flyingdragon6275 wouldn t even be surprised lol
 aaravdeo is t series a person  how do i tell a digital name on my screen which does not even have a relevant meaning that they are humble  you know humbleness is a human feature right 
 scr3am273 i was talking about the people behind t series  yes it is a corporation  but someone does own it  i was just refering to everyone behind t series as  t series 
 patrick39 good joke
 aaravdeo so we are supposed to tell a  corporation  that they are humble  what exactly the humble gesture that corp did 
  aaravdeoare you calling a corporation as  humble  like what are you even talking about
how am i here at 1 view
i considered mr beast a company but pewdiepie is just one single man along with one editor
this  i pretty much said the same thing so technically he is still the most single man with most subs
same  youtuber vs corporate funded corporations  hmm  its like dr disrespect going up against disney for entertainment
no excuses  the branding is what counts
 stephhatake2267 nope
 shadowrlx yea branding is crucial
 yeaman i think i m pretty better than you
you will always be our number one bro  
noooooooooooooo
pewdiepie still number 1 in our hearts 
yioooooo
this means war
maybe because he s actually doing something
hi
impossible 
cannot believe jimmy whose alone inspiration was pewds now has more subscribers than him
hello
mrbeast is better than pewdiepie
mr beast should be consider an enterprise as same as t series and cocomelon  change my mind
pewds forever
you will always be the youtube goat
first
still numero uno 
nooooooooo   
pewdiepie will be always  1
       people might not see this comment  but everybody stay safe and have a blessed day my god be with you all     happy holidays take care everyone     
still the goat of youtube
pewds hit the milestone first  but both are epic
  
felix does not check the comments anymore
 ratio
you are at least making more videos than him i love you more than him 
i miss the old times 
sad
 
     whoever is reading this     i pray that whatever you are going through gets better and whatever you are struggling with or worrying about   is going to be fine i wish you all the best of what life has to offer        have a great day  
first
books are book
the true winner shall be determined by a semen chugging competition
this is a perfect example of  the student surpassing the master 
i bet it blow up
fr
well  mrbeast was never student or servant of pewdiepie
lol
that mrbeast s vide  saying pewdiepie for 100k times  was a ritual all along
my name
 foxyfnlolno
 foxyfnlol lol
youtube comments are ruined because of these spam bots
 ashishkhetwal sure maybe not necessarily  but he was still the closest there was to that
you took the words right out of my mouth  also  report the bots replying to your comment 
 ashishkhetwal kind of was  felix was his greatest inspiration
hello fellow goat simulator fan
i am not question to you 
 ashishkhetwal he was a diehard supporter of pewdiepie during the t series vs pewdiepie thing   i am assuming that is what they are referring to 
man this makes me sad    i do not know why but this passing of subscribers reminds me of gohan vs cell fight  as the comment says  the student surpasses the master  brings back so many memories of me and my friends watching mrbeast s bottle flip and fidget spinner challenges  pewdiepie s beastmaster64 videos  the legendary jumping out of the closet bits  and best of all   happy wheels  it was a simpler time back then 
 ashishkhetwal it is a thing called metaphor  look it up some time 
nah it s just that there are more young people entering tyt everyday
no fan surpassing the idol loll
yup
 my work here is done 
epictaeus  wether you should turn left or right in your tesla 3  hmm  yes  life fixed  thxxx 
but the master will always be the master to the student
indeed
except he did not lol
jesus christ died for our sins and rose again put your trust in jesus christ 
 connie tinuityerror i know that he did not mean to say mrbeast was student of pewdiepie and he was comparing this event with something like this  the comment  but i just want to say mrbeast has created his own legacy and you cannot say that pewdiepie is the reason of that
 oreogodking whatever i will just pin down mr beast if he dares to surpass my infinite power
 tebestyt  
 tebestyt bro cocomelon is going to have a great comeback  
 yeaman i do not remember asking plus who cares
 ashishkhetwal i mean during the pewdiepie v  tseries thing he did a lot of stuff to try and get pewds to win
jessir
goodt
lesgo book review  need more of these
is science related to math 
1st
nooo
zombies die         
love both channels 
best bait
you are dead
where the happy wheels part 200
bro fist 
congratulations 2   
love you pea pew
mrbeast and pewdiepie are equally phenonmebal in delivering content throughout the years  their sheer talent and dedication was what brought them ultimate success in the end 
 yeaman page 
though mr beast is more like a corporation at this point
squeezie      
jesus loves you all   remember that he died and rose up again for you to be in heaven with him  believe on his name and repent of your sins and be saved  have an amazing day      
phenonmebal  uh huh
 gg ij7li please respond to this question  are you a bot 
 user mn2lg9qy4d  remember that jesus did not respawn and that god is merely the way you act
 phenomenal
my name
eh i don t really like mr beast  i basically watched him until the first time he gave away 1 million then it was just boring 
the f is  phenonmebal 
though mr  beast didn t have anyone shouting him out to get subs  everyone was shouting out pewdiepie to get him to 100 mill
 yeaman  bot 
 f1shm3n his money is enough of a shout out lol
 therealright you all got to stop making up excuses and just accept the fact that mrbeast dethroned pewdiepie  it was inevitable man  times change
 gg ij7li amen
swedish boy better f r fan
 shadowrlx i am not making excuses because i do not really care about those numbers  he is self made but at this point became a company  so they still do not really compare
nope  one has had to buy viewers  the other one hasn t 
mr beasts content is kind of boring and like others have said  more like a corporation  he still deserves to be where he is though
 finominl
 therealright no lol  the branding is what counts  so if we use your logic  then  pewdiepie  is a duo and stopped being an individual creator a long time ago
mr beast just shouts an idea for a video and then films his friends doing it  the guy has 0 personality  like as an adult  i cannot bare mr beast but i still watch pewdiepie sometimes  
 shadowrlx no you
i am mr beast  and today  i am locking all my friends in prison for a week   and then  shout  the winner gets xcar house money    success  he might as well partner with ryans toy review 
 yeaman bro are you on every video  stop trolling bro
mr  beast isn t talented  funny  or creative  he got famous by saying logan paul a bunch of times and giving away a bunch of money  pewds got famous by making actual entertaining content 
 allenreviews this  i have always thought mr beast has 0 personality  humour or creativeness  he just seems awkward the entire time he is on screen  like you say  the difference between him and pewds is enormous  mr beast has the charisma of a wet towel 
first
 
anyway we love you bro
hi

the dutch toilet actually seems genius  it looks like it would prevent splashback without the need for toilet paper 
                   
amazing pewdiepie keep up the good work   
as a fellow dutchman i would appreciated not being banned   sincerely a dutchman
my heart is cold
i am dutch but the hole is in the back in my toilet  
      
honestly i think i would prefer the bag slapper over poseidons kiss

another cursed comment from me here  i actually googled that disease  it is really bad  but i could not unsee that those guys had part of berserk s brand of sacrifice on their backs 
sooooo weird watching piewdiepie in 2023  feels like hoping on a time machine  and yet it all feels sooo fake  i have a feeling hes acting man

huehuehue 
looking back after 2 sonic movies its wild how they thought the anthropomorphic sonic was ever a good idea 
mrbeast is better
actually in peru  and other countries in south america  we eat hamsters lul they are called cuy
i recently watched a doco about the problem of space in cemeteries  some jurisdictions are working around the problem by lowering graves that are 100 years old and burying another person on top  like a double decker bus  others are doing exactly like this video and burying people vertically  some cemeteries then plant a tree instead of a tombstone and register the coordinates of the grave 
6 13 no that guy is wrong  if you cannot move your penis without clenching your asshole you have an issue  presumably a skill one
i do not know i can move my dick without clenching my butthole  seems like a skill issue

             damn i am a player
ok for the one where it claims you cannot move your penis without clenching your butthole is wrong clench your ass in the  lower part of it and your butthole will close and your penis will not move as long you do not move
              
         
        
i believe this is pewdiepie s sixth ever episode of cursed comments  he just keeps coming back

consider where your soul will spend eternity  heaven or hell   you don t want to end up in hell because you rejected the sacrifice jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith   we are all guilty of sin   we lie  steal and look with lust in our hearts   we are all guilty before a holy and righteous god   god is not just all loving and overlook your sin   he is loving but sin he will judge because he is perfectly good  the good news is god the father sent his son jesus christ who was perfectly holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of love for us   we can t keep the law we break most all commandments   but jesus fulfilled all by his perfect thoughts  words  deeds and motives for us because we could not  jesus loved all humans and god the father perfectly   turn  repent of your sin and confess your thankfulness for what jesus did for you   put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of christ   jesus was raised from death to give you new life  death has been defeated  out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith

9 11 was a false flag operation 
those toilets are lower because they are specifically designed for women  not all dutch people know this and buy a low toilet instead of a normal one 
how is poods know about xvideos
older stepmom can be awkward of course  but considering she is in her 20 s it probably will not matter  she is not really her stepmom  she is just her dad s wife

       these r my first and third
i do not know if it s like that in every country but normally you pay the grave for a specific amount of years so for example 20 and when that time is up you either pay a second time or they re use the place
so it s basically depending on the type of earth you have  could be 10 but could also be 40 years  anyway if you decide to not pay for it and they start digging up the grave for re using they normally just take all the bones etc they find and bury them further down so a new grave can be on top
missed you pewds

minecraft is videos please 
i liked the 2010 pewdiepie better than the 2023 pewdiepie  he was alot better at gaming and he actually played good games you had gotten worse  over time you are getting so weird and cringe  i like t series more than you now used i liked you more  what did you do to get worse  you need to play better games like  war thunder  ylands  minecraft  horror games that was released before this week  also play some of your old games you used to play  also your glasses look like their cost 400 dollars  that  just a flex 
bro  he is retired from gaming as a millionaire before the age of 35  this is a hobby to him now  not a job  he truly does not give a shit how you feel about him 
if i get 1 million subscribers in my channel  i am going to smash a 10 000 euro watch

can i 
looking back some years when pewdiepie vs t series was  why  youtube existed  i feel so good seeing pewdiepie still stuck in some 110 mill subs and t series at almost 250 mil    i must say it is karma pewdiepie deserved to stay low below t series 
he is still more succesful than you  he can buy your whole generations  
are you done in youtube 
hello pewdiepie
bro 
i miss this guy in my yt
          
3 10   for no reason i remembered that some people s name was just a small rectangle on the ground  no tombstone  like a car plate on the floor instead of a big one that has a tombstone on one end and a large rectangle marble floor in front of it i am guessing the vertical options are the  affordable  ones for those that cannot break the bank for premium space

these toilets have an advantage that you are able to see and investigate your actual excrement  which is sometimes handy during sickness which is why older people use them more  these toilets also don t splash that much  which might be a preference for some      
                
pewd is back

post more plz
can i have a shout out please
 get out 
hey pewdiepie  i have got an idea  i have realized that you should hire interpreters for subtitles or dubbing  i think it makes your videos more watchable and understandable for people who do not know english  people from other countries can watch your videos more easily  for instance  interpreters can add 3 5 subtitles for languages that your viewers where from  actually  even english subtitles by youtube does not working well  at least please add professional english subtitle for your every videos  i think with this way you can earn more and have more viewers  it is so simple i think  i hope you will see my comment and tell your opinion about it  have a great day 
i am dutch  and never understood why  regular  toilets are made the way they are  when you poop on a  regular  toilet  every turd that leaves the butt causes a splash of water pee in the toilet to splash upwards and wet your a shole and b allsack  dutch toilets all the way

the dutch kind of toilet were made so you could look at your poop to see if its healthy or not  its a little outdated but its function was simple but effective  for older people its still very handy because they have more health problems and stool is always a greate indicator  the more you know

felix  i am friends with an man who claims your loyal subscriber almost killed an autistic man in 2014  defaming his name  almost made him commit suicide  choosing a crack head in the navy over him who also loves your channel felix  mind giving emily gantner a lesson about humility  how she should not defame people just because she was extremely sexually predatory in person  seducing him then claiming false rape  this was in 2014 he said  before metoo  and weinstein

we all can agree pewdiepie never disappoints us with his content
with his stupidity you mean 
about the dutch toilets  they designed it that way so that you can look at your stool incase you are sick etc 
comment down below if you clenched your butt
in a single video  pewds snitched on himself having small pp whilenalso encouraging to eat one s sister  wtf  
          
         
5 00 my man straight up asked his existence  but not alone 
we are uncle now guys 
the penis butthole one got me rolling bro    
just for anyone wondering about the graveyard thing  first of all they put the coffins laying down so the loved one can  rest  hence the phrase put to rest  that is obvious but anyways obviously you have to pay whoever runs the cemetery to hold that coffin there and if by the the time you cannot make pay or everyone who did pay to hold the spot passed on or moved away they just dig up the coffin and cremate what is left making space for new coffins
amouranth had stream with adult stars doing smash or pass you were there they said smash but you are having a baby mehh
as a fellow dutchmen  i would like to say sorry for the disgusting images about the toilet 
i love you pewidepie

i love the mix between the old  silly pdp  persona for commentary and serious felix for the vlogs lol  the commentary makes me think of 2017 pewds  like pew news or meme review lol 
the dutch toilets are made like that so the turd doesn t splash up the disgusting toilet water against your exposed poopy anus
      
i need to se a vid of that prank whit the menikin
sub cao m  sao  t ng  i xem v nh   
i wanted to see pewds pattern i wanted to seeeeeeee
the moment in the vid when you kno  pewds clinched and wiggled his pp
hi
            
instead of saying  pro tip  you should say  bro tip 
can confirm the hamster one  when i was little i tried washing my sister s hamster and accidently drowned it
 
i had a distant cousin who had fibrodyslasia  his bottom half turned into stone  he eventually died of it in his 40s of organ failure
hey pewds  this is out of context  but thank you for helping me through this hard time  its been very difficult situation that i faced  but your videos and the happiness that you always shared has been a great way for me to have your presence beside me  thank you  again
 there is zero pictures of earth from space  wtf
i really wana like this comment but its at 69 and i really like that number so ill just comment here saying that i like your comment
thanks pewds for proving that there are so many sheep  keep following people  do not find out things for yourselves  just watch vids  baaahh 
i dare you all to complete 1k subscribers i bet you cannot
bro stuck at 111m subscribers
imagine those following fans follow you into your home  your not allowed to kick them out  and then that just becomes permanent 
as a fellow dutchman  i can say that these toilets are still better than the ball watering  sloppy kiss providing  belching pisswater deodarant ball scent providing toilets that can be found elsewhere 
as a fellow dutchman  i do not see the problem with the toilet 
the dutch toilet is naught buta commodity for pure pleasure 
pewdssss are you going to play the re4 remake  it is sooo good 
my sisters hamster committed suicide by climbing up me and jumping off my shoulder i tried getting it but i couldn t 
hejsan felix ahr inte varit inne p  din kanal p  s  l nge och ass  du  r s  j vla bra jag saknar n r du brukade spela outlast och sv ra p  svenska det var s  roligt  det legendariska var ju pewdiepie vs t series det var sjukt 
mr beast has more subs he s better than you
 chloeandcarlgaming6580 cool  felix is a retired millionaire before the age of 40  pretty sure he does not give a shit lol  he does not need subs anymore  he can actually live his life instead of pandering to kids like mr beast does 
is it the light or do you have to eat some more ramen 
i thought he was going to say the n word again
as a dutchman i hate them too the toilets
the bag slapper toilets have the antvantage that you do not get water sprayed at your ass  which is way more likely to happen than a bag slapper  just saying
started watching some old gameplay vids of yours and they have made me happier than i have been in a while  resubbing because you are still a funny guy and i have missed enjoying your vids 
          
2 32 damn it dutch 
  it s good trust me
           
the dutch toilet is so much better  the turd does not fall into the deep water  but on a platform  thatway you do not get a toiletwater splash 
i fucking died  when you looked up nickacado avacado what the fuck ever his name is because i do the exact same thing  wondering if he does the exact same shit and yep  he sure is  lmao

the dutch toilets are old school  modern bathrooms do not have them anymore  fun fact the myth is that people wanted to see if their poop looked healthy or not before flushing
why does anyone use plastic straws when the cornstarch ones are amazing 
the hole in the dutch toilets look so weird  not going to lie lol 
i thought you tried to rob me yesterday
what your not a channel member
i love the evolution of pewds 
this toilet is to prevent the kiss of poseidon   you do not want that

why do you guys call  juice  anything but  juice 
7 11 i can answer that   dis  prefix refers to  nothing  root  ease  refers to  absense of difficulty or effort  a disease lacks comfort  it inconveniences anyone or anything to some capacity  why is painful not painless  because painful embodies the sensation of hurt  painless makes the hurt less  disease versus ease  painful versus painless  pain and ease  these root words are one prefix or suffix away from a different definition

how does everyone feel about the song choice  i am curious  to me  it is in a weird place between fitting because it is so chill and the video has a nostalgic feel for some reason  but also not fitting because it is chord progression in g minor sounds a bit too sad for the light  comedic nature of the video 
pls unretire i was so sad when you did and still am

nan
        
as an epic swedish graveyard worker  it is not uncommon when digging a grave that you dig up bone pieces  but to answer felix s question  we stack them  so in one grave there might be 2 3 coffins on top of eachother  so they would take up the same amount of space even if we stand them upright  thanks for reading my ted talk 
my amazing emoji pattern              
no no hear me out  the toilets are like the so the water does splash on you ass  its better believe me  just do not shit wholse ass telephone poles  i think that story said more about the writer of the backslapper than about the toilet

bruh when i was a kid the hamster committed sepuku because there was a small hole in the top of the cage  which the cat would taunt him with his paw  it was never big enough for the cat to actually do anything to him  i was passing by  and i saw the cat told it to knock it off  it listened but kept looking at the hamster  i guess the hamster had enough because as i picked up the cat to move it away  the hamster knocked its wheel onto himself        it stopped moving  i told my aunt to which she said  damn that fool had enough  huh

about timeeeeeeee
cursed comments are finally back 
my hampster starved to death when it refused to eat after we bought it from the previous owners
so it turns out that the dutch toilet is designed like that so that people can examine their shit for any diseases or whatnot before they flush it  i still do not understand how you cannot examine your shit with a normal designed toilet   thanks to dutch toilet design  you are given the opportunity to examine your expelled matter before sending it to the sewer  while it is an appalling view  it is also a practical one  many diseases and health issues can be detected by examining stool samples 
mr beast
this kind of video makes me miss pewdiepie everyday the most 
the dutch toilet is a type of toilet which was used in the olden days  it used to come in handy to check your   once in a while  the bycatch was that there was no splash involved

my hamster when i was kid was called beeny   he was cool until one day he just climbed the kitchen cabinets   took a brief moment to look down from his new great height and he jumped   no note  no explanation   we were hanging out sharing a peanut butter sandwich an hour earlier  he had never been up there before  he did not do anything else up there and he knew the way down from climbing up  it was deliberate   i just did not know hamsters did that   everytime i look at a rodent now i wonder if it is somehow depressed

after quite some time coming back to this channel  it just pains me to see he is still at 111m subscribers  there was a time when his name in a youtube video would get thousands of views  memes  jokes  collabs etc etc  now it feels like he is slowly fading away from everyone is memories  all i can say is that he is still my favorite youtuber  and it just pains me to see him fading like this just pains me 
i think that is what he wants   he is retired  youtube is a hobby for him now

i just came back after years of not watching this guy and now he looks like steve jobs
pewds pulling a muscle from laughing reminded me we are all getting old with him
believe it or not  the  dutch toilet  design is for avoiding splashes and  most importantly  to let you take a good look at the condition of your turd before you flush it down 
great ad placement
i like melon

as a dutch woman  never had issues with this toilet  i rather have this toilet then the water splashers
pewds doing another cancel speed run lmao
why not just preserve cadavers in epoxy resin and keep them vertically more space and you have something to look at instead of gravestones   
nice video thank you big fan  i love you bro         
hello brother how are you
as a dutch guy  i have rarely encountered those toilets but when i did  it was indeed a bad experience  
loving pewd s glasses  classy 
as a fellow dutchman this hurt
the way danny devito came out from the toilet hahahahah
this video is literally 20  ad wtf
             
yes at last
looks like pewds is back to editing videos himself
 nd if you bury the bodies halfway through  you can save money on the memorial
you are a amazing youtuber
to explain the dutch toilet  that plateau is so you can check your stool for irregularities and contact your doctor if needed source  am dutch
thank you pewdiepie for uploading amazing videos i have supported you for a long time and i still support you felix you are videos are so amazing
as a fellow dutch canadian  i can happily say that i have never got the experience of a bag slapper 
i can t wait for him to become a dad and tell his kid how he calls all those kids in his videos  lol
you know you all clenched your ass at the same time despite knowing already you can do it
spice up your sex life with the dutch back slapper 
funny how pewdiepie managed to post the video with the nether plant   
if my parent ever married someone younger than me  especially after cheating on my other parent   they would be dead to me   seriously   would cut contact   that is fucked up 
as a fellow dutchman  i actually prefer dutch toilets over other ones  the point is not we do not sit backward or in some weird way on a toilet but these toilets have the pro that when you shit the water cannot splash back to your ass 
do dutch belgians also fall under the  ban dutch people rule  
i am suddenly no longer dutch  just so i can stay on this channel xd
this is what i needed today  
finish terraria

english toilet  1 toilet roll per day  before using the toilet you throw some down to avoid splash back  dutch toilet  1 4 toilet roll per day  you just cannot fit that much toilet paper in it without it touching you   this is why there was a toilet paper shortage in england xd next up   sinks stink   the to hot to cold experience  d

have done some gravedigging in my time  i am sure its different in different countries but  organics decay real fast including the wooden caskets  so old spots can and do get reused  also burial depth is used  first body goes deep  next a little bit more shallow  next one more so  and yes  sometimes you end up in a hole with bad times  especially when its raining a lot   fun fact  we had a thin metal stick we could poke the ground real deep to  feel  that there was not any   solids  from the old times when records where kept worse   a fellow swede with a past in cemetary groundskeeping

apologize accepted 
i am sorry to say that i am unfortunately a victim of the dutch bag slapper on a normal toilet  
for people as sad as i  the dutch have their toilets that way for a reason  it is so that you can look at your poop properly before it goes in the water or is flushed so you can see warning signs of any bowel  liver and stomach issues or dietary problems early   like blood or food you are struggling to process  apparently the dutch have really good health rates because of it and often catch cancer overall faster than other countries because of it   mad gross  though 
        
you should eat your sister    you know i have seen a disturbing trend in hollywood horror that involves parents or siblings in bedrooms   i think they may have gotten to pewds
nice video
          
who clenched his butthole  
i want a toilet with a turd platform
with that amount of prescience  felix may as well be the kwisatz haderach
we do not have plastic straws anymore  thanks turtles  d  d
            
ser jorah in the back with the stone skin lol
i hate those toilets
hello  pewdiepie  do you know a game called tower defence online  it is a game in which four players kill monsters and protect their castles  it is really fun  so please do it
i like pewdiepie
nan
i like how pewds matched the video look with the idea
making a pattern with 1 st and 3 d emoji             
bro didn t let it focus  now we ll never know his emojis
        
ahh yes the annual cursed comments video
                
why does he look like my elementary school bully in the ad read
lol  i actually dig graves for a living  pewds  hit me up
 
            
             
pewds  you should do an episode watching suppernanny  it s iconic  basically this british nanny comes and tells the parents what they need to improve on so their kids are not jerks  i would recommend watching the cooke family 
31st in gaming videos
he put that in the tags for the video
           
fucking bag slap
    hello pewdiepie
pewds getting back on that horse  is the horse joergen smoergen   o more minecraft coming soon 
whatdidido 
those dutch toilets prevent the water from splashing up and they can also come in handy when someone is sick and their poop needs to be checked   i am dutch  i know i am banned  i do not care  p 
sitting on dutch toilet right now  it a very nice toilet  you can inspect your poop and see if you are healthy
             
paper straws turn liquid into air
bro fist thanks pewds
as a fellow dutchman  i can say that those toilets are actually pretty rare  and most of our toilets are the correct ones  with the air filter above the toilet hole 
dutch bag slapper is my new favorite saying
6 20 is my favorite moment here     that is power you cannot buy    
watched whole video  still do not know what he is apologizing for 
the dutch toilet one i do not know what that guy went trough but in my 23 years here it never happend and i never heard something like that   i mean we got this so when you poop the water does not splash up to your ass
here as a dutchman
            
2 15 so called  bag slappers 
           
        
 i cannot wait to be a dad  and this put a smile to my face  their kid will have one of a heck life lol
4 31         
thank you pewds for making us clench our buttholes in unison
i cannot believe he is already apologizing truly a pewdiepie s foresight 
eating cereal while watching this video was not the smartest idea
seriously  how is that avocado dude still alive 
i am actually in the  mother s eye  situation right now  but without the  30m  if i win it though  i will definitely buy her a lamborghini and an eye patch now 
i m banned  
vpn  more like pee pee n  am i right 
i ve been waiting for cursed comments for 3 years  
okay so as a dutch person living close to belgium those toilets have a plateau because you can look at your   to see if you are sick pls do not ban me 
finally peak content
i am dutch and i have a normal toilet  can i stay senpai pewds   
2 50 my sisters hamster we believed to have passed away and so we found a shoebox and i buried the hamster for her as she was distraught  he was not showing signs of breathing and could not feel any pulse  but later found out that he could have possibly been hibernating and hamsters could appear dead and have no visible heartbeat or respiration  so i may or may have not buried a hamster alive without knowing  moral of the story  none of my family members will ever be owning a hamster any time in the future as none of us would want an animal that we would not be able to find out if dead or alive  i would not want a dead animal sitting in a cage and me leaving it that way  it just sounds like the 1 pet you just would not want as a pet
awesome
         
what is up with the dutchphobia  holland aan de top

pewdiepie
this subreddit again let us go  these are always some of my favorite pewds vids lol
actually you can move your pp without clenching your asshole  it just takes practice   
yessss  another reddit review
            
pewds finally admits to his small peepee killer alternative identity  may god help us all
1 49 i swear in the 18 years of my existence i have never seen this here
got one at home  hate it  what area of the netherlands are you from  because if this is just happening in amsterdam  it is good to at least have located the problem 
 
actually funny  i do not know what else to say
pewds with the 10min push
watch t series subs man 
        
as a fellow dutchperson i can say that once you experience our toilets your whole life will change 
do you think the reason pewds took forever to figure out what was wrong with that toilet is because he still shits in the shower   
dutch toilets are made of suppressors to keep the pissing from being too loud    
7 45 i am truly worried for his child s future

hi pewdiapai
did he have a baby   
            
1 00 unironically people have been telling media to do this for decades lol but  the small peepee killer  does not get the same ratings as  they bayharbour butcher  hehe 
        
my friend had a hamster  one day her cousin visit and decided to pee in the hamster in the hamster water and it died from toxicated ammonia
i clicked on this thinking it was an old video  and i could swear i remembered some parts of the video
i was waiting for someone is first and third emoji to be         
              
               
pewdiepie completely missed the dutch toilet
i am happy that get to support his chalenge 10k
i am happy that get to support his chalenge 10k
1 06 holy  yes  they should actually preserve the junk of every serial killer in formaldehyde after they get got  then they should just have a 24 hour public stream that never stops running with a camera just watching the jars 
 blacklivesmatter would you want to be out murdering people if that was the real consequence 
really enjoyed this video  thanks pewds    
          
            
                 
the dutch toilets are intented to be able to inspect your poop  you know yourself and your poop  it can tell you if something is wrong with your body  the poop speaks  listen to the health advice of the poop
pew has been busy collecting dog foods
for a holiday  you should consider a road trip around australia  north queensland  south australia  central coast nsw  northern wa are very beautiful  but i could see it being a 3 month thing
bro needs to play outlast trials
insteas of jack the ripper we call him  john the hiding bitch boy 
they have eco cemetaries in australia where they dig the grave with a big auger and bury you standing up  and when it is full they just re auger the first grave and grind the remains up  or at least that was being planned 
        
hey pewds  are not you going to enroll on kendo school your in japan already  would be fun seeing you in kendo school 
but wait the video was not 10 minutes long
as a dutch woman i have never seen a toilet like that here  we do have normal toilets  please do not ban me
3 35 pewds what 
i cannot believe pewds is banning us dutch people for being able to shit all the letters of the alphabet and admire it after
like the comment please
dads back 
welps i am banned  by the way we do not have a toilet like that xd 
why is the bgm so inspiring 
well i have been here for a long time but goodbye felix  x a dutch female     
hi
as a fellow dutch man  i ll still watch pewds channel  stop me bitch 
made my day with a single video
should not have tried to eat while watching
bro fop is a goddamm jojo reference
as a fellow dutch man  i can confirm that nothing like that ever happens  bag slapper  the toilet is honestly way better like that because you do not have the splash effect
omg the dutch toilet  i was so surprised the first time i saw it  i never saw a toilet designed like that   now that i am living in the netherlands  i still hate it lol
wait but for real why do not people get buried vertically  it does make a more efficient use of the space available  does not it 
ksi better
where child
derp  inside his wife 
curious if pewdiepie will turn into a boring dad with a  mature  filter  ugh i hate people who do that after having their first kid 
            
mr beast has more subs haha
felix is a retired millionaire and does not need to simp for subs like mr beast does   
 spawn point when does mrbeast simp for subs 
 oliver 04 all the time  you think the fanboys coming here from mr beast and t series proclaiming their undying love for them are not being paid to do that  
 spawn point i do not think they are  remember when pewdiepie made all his fanboys go around spewing subscribe to pewdiepie
petition  put nsfw on title  i was eating dinner when the dutch toilet section came up  almost enjoyed what i am eating as the bag slapper was describe  flavor would have been better if samples was included 
ahhh i was hoping poods would come back to this subreddit
          
game video plasee 
you understand he is retired now  right 
what is wrong with our toilets 
i was in the army with a person who had not fop but stiff person syndrome  his disease symptoms would be cramps all over the body on all muscles   he had to be administrated muscle loosening drugs in regular time spans so he would remain functional  possibly the happiest and most humorous person i have ever met and i hope he spreads joy to this day 
subscribe need 1 person looking for a friend
but how
my hamster started bleading from his mouth and my brothers hamster pooped out his organs  can confirm the statement in the video
to the extremist vegan protest  we had people put fliers on chicken eggs in stores saying  i could have had a life  keep in mind these are unfertilized and would never actually carry life 
 is that fckr still around  
did you get a new editor   
sorry nord vpn the american gov is tryna make it illegal for me to have you  
it is ok felix  upload whenever you can  we are still here for you  by the way  i wore my 90 million subscribers jacket to my doctor appointment and the nurse asked why i was wearing a coffin logo with 90 million on it  since it is a  green camo  pattern she asked what war i was referring  i said   it was the horrible t series war  it actually ended with over 100 million  and i have a hoodie representing that  too   said excitedly as i stated 100 million  she walked out with a huge confused look on her face  not able to figure out which war it referred to  she looked back  then wrote something in my file  felix  we shall never forget 
sir  we need to talk about 4 08
guess i am banned now  nothing wrong with that toilet 
dutch toilet looks like they are designed to prevent splashback 
      
i just noticed your 720p 50fps setting  that is so cool  i can definitely tell the upgrade to your video editing  your camera has to rock 
i think our toilets look like that so we can make to our children learn to write by making them practice pooping letters  i have four year old brother and everytime is done pooping he yells  i am ready  he then expects everyone in the house to gather around and praise him if he successfully pooped a letter  right now he is very focused on perfecting the letter p  i am so proud of him
thanks for the upload pewpeepie  
i would sit backwards on that dutch horror of a creation before ever getting slapped 
some of us mostly hang around for the reaction gaming videos  so no need for an apology to us   
ahhh this feels nice  this feels like some of his older content  back when i woke up every day waiting for that upload  no hate on his current stuff  this just felt nice 
pewds it is time to you unlock new skill  and it is dadjoke
as a fellow dutch man  these toilets are fine
as a fellow dutchman i have had the same experience with a bag slapper
me thinking the video s ending  nordvpn standing at the top of the stairs and standing  menacingly 
as a fellow dutchman  i can explain   the toilets are made that way so you can see if your shit is a healthy one and not a bad one  
heyy  the small pp killer  did he not react to this one years ago 
phenomenon  word pewds is unable to pronounce
on twitch  someone hacked your account 
4 05 furry confirmed
pewds  this will sound crazy  but please be careful and look out for yourself   when i felt the best in my life  everything was taken away 
i have a feeling pewdiepie does sponsorships just so he raises money which he will give away just like bill gates
last video  stoic  eminently poetic and new life cheerishing  well edited with a touch of family friendliness showing us how felix has evolved beyond the internet drama  this video  nick fury mom in lamborghini  dutch toilet bag slapper 
about the toilet  it is true  but also  it is easy to see when you are sick  black turd  stomach bleeding  red  bloody turd  possible colon cancer   no joke  the plateau has a medical function 
i mean you can choose from the bag slapper or poseidon kiss 
         
why did i clench my butthole  do i have secret pp 
sponsorship at the end what 
0 55 tbf that is the journalist way to not get targeted by the serial killer while covering the crime  also i do not think that serial killers will stop killing if give them a dumb name  if anything  thay kill even more out of frustration from being called so 
mainstream media   pewdiepie in another drama   get clickbaited 
cream of the crop   1 35 pewds  nah  top of the cream

sorry for your loss   condolences

my condolences  may he rest in peace 
i lost my grand dad too recently may he rest in peace

8 seconds away from the 10 minute mark  he has lost his way
hey pewds  is your twitch channel hijacked 
                         
the hamster thing is true  i do not know why   lol  mine died when i was 11   i have both hamsters and guinea pigs   young me thought it was a big brain move to put them in the same cage thinking they might do the honky donky and i will get a hamster guinea pig hybrid   woke up next day with my hamster missing his noggin

5 18 father left a ak 49 for a reason  i know what i must do 
              
 
fop one scared me fr
als a fellow dutch  i love these toilets  you are always forced to watch your own shit before flushing
i m from belgium and one time when i was in 5th grade we were going to the nederlands for one week without our family then i went to the toilet and i saw that toilets and i said wtf is this typ of a toilet i never forget that toilet  
are not no way  i thought this an old video  but here we are
1 45 to be fair they look like that in austria as well  
        
          
as a dutchman  i can explain the dutch toilets design  the hole your poopoo will flush trough is so far forward to stop the water from splooshing up when the poo falls in  no more toilet water splashing onto your balls when taking poopoo  and that story of the big turd is bullcrap  never have i ever heard that before
we have those in austria and they suck  if you shit too much the flush will not be able to flush it  all down  worst case scenario  one has to manually ger it down 
i don t know why but pew look cringe  not funny anymore
just you mate
as a fellow dutch man  the toilets are not a problem but i also have the normal type in my house
i am dutch  hate the toilets with a fishbowl of water in it  each time you poop  the splash is awful
do you have makeup on  it looks like it when looking at your forehead  not judging just wondering  
thank you master of masters pewdiepie    
i would rather get a poseidon s kiss than a bag slapper
pewds can you please play resident evil 4 remake
pewds play resident evil 4 remake man bring back gaming pewds  
aiight it was a good run  see ya   
to clarify on the dutch toilets  definitely not all look like these  for some reason they are mostly found in offices  schools and other workplaces  i remember hearing once that their function is so that you can inspect your shit  which can say something about your health  you can also write letters if you re skilled
these toilets with hole in the front are so much better  grew up with one and did not once experience a bag slapper  when dropping a log into a toilet with the hole in the back my ass gets greeted with a poseidons kiss every single time  i hate it 
take your time pewds  enjoy your time 
nooooooo mister pew  as a fellow dutch man i hate the stupid people that created such goofy toilets  i think the whole world should have japanese toilets  those are way better
2 37
those toilets are called  vlakspoeler  translated to flatflusher  it was used in hopitals at first to examine the faeces  but some people thought it was necessary to put it in their homes 
so used to showers  you forgot what a toilet supposed to look like huh pewds   
my sister drowned her hamster by  giving her a bath 
          
god damn it  i have the same sense of humor as felix  i always go back to this subreddit too    
as a fellow dutchman  my other fellow dutchman is in fact  unfortunately  correct  i must also say however that these styles of toilets do not have any backsplash  so in the end  you win some you lose some
1 40 i am dutch  and have one of those toilets downstairs and a reguelair toilet upstairs  and i have never questioned it until now 
finally pewds did another one these cursed comments vids  
i am actually  surprised he found posts which aren t to cursed for youtube guidelines
7 11 because random mutations on genes aren t good  but somehow people believe in evolution

my dwarf hamster got stuck under his transparent food bowl  where he starved died of thirst  i was on holiday and my dad was supposed to check on him  he assumed it was hiding 
i live five km from the dutch border  every time we go shopping there and have to go to a toilet we hope it s not one of those 
bag slapper is my new favourite word
so fop literaly makes you into an armoured titan  weirdly into it
i musta had one of those rare  dies peacefully  hamsters  poor little guy lived for almost a decade  he became so old he got cancer about 4 times  and lost an eye in the process  not to mention he ended up with little dreadlocks  which despite making him look cool  did nothing for his taste in music  he died peacefully at the ripe old age of 8 years old 
i fucking hate reddit so much
cemitery with people being  buried  vertically already exist  except they do not relly get burried  search it  it is  kind of normal

this is incredible
as a fellow dutch person  the bag slapper is either a joke  or personal issue that he said is common to feel better about himself  never had a bag slapper  not to mention he is not healthy keeping his sh t in for so long 
he is still the best youtuber  dang 
hi
did he get a new editor  this is kind of shit
whoever edited this video has a sense of humor  it is been a while since that happened
pewds is so handsome man
          cute
            
no as a dutch i can explain  it is so you are poo do not splash water against you are butt
why would you make toilets like that  there is no splash  you know  the ones that hit your butt and a  hole  the worst thing of toilets  where the filthy water used by previous users with i do not know what diseases they have and used it  and that contaminated water splashes against your back  that kind of prevention is what dutch toilets do 
thank you for the laughs pyudee
  
lmao love it all
damn  pewds banned me
you had better bury the tall folks deeper than 6 feet or their heads will stick out which will give new meaning to headstone 
the fact that you are still uploading despite taking the next step in your life  relationship and marriage  makes me appreciate you even more  always a bro

wow pewd is back  missed subreddit vids so much  thanks  
as a fellow dutch women  you can check your health by checking your shit on the little display  also  no splash 
1 54 here to explain myself  i have been living here for 12 years and not even once have i seen a toilet with the hole in the front  even in my house it is just normal at the back  he must have gone to some weird hotel with front hole toilets 
i am dutch and i have a toilet like this at my place  so do my parents at theirs   i hate it with all my heart  what area of the netherlands are you from  maybe the bad toilets are amsterdam toilets 
 poprecorders  probably since that is most probably where the photo was taken since it is the most popular city  i am from doetinchem and we just would not go if the toilets looked like that
nice   
i do not understang a single world  but have fun  my beechy bunny 
he is starting to look more and more like his dad
cannot get enough apologies for this   
    
man a wish that pewds will never stop uploading his life and this type of video
just finished reading a story about a woman from pennsylvania named carol orzel who suffered from fop and managed to live a distinguished life despite being physically handicapped by the age of 23   in addition to her data keeping profession and active personal life  she became a model figure for students and scientists to study the quickly developing but still poorly understood subject  working with academics and media outlets alike to increase public awareness and intrigue for such an incredibly rare but serious disorder  towards the end of her life she was shown the remains of a man with the same condition who died decades earlier and donated his body to science   after seeing this  she decided she wanted to do the same   she passed in early 2018 at the ripe age of 58  18 years past the average life expectancy  her carefully preserved skeleton is now on display alongside the man s in the m tter museum at the college of physicians of philadelphia 
reddit reviews are baaaaaackkkkk  please say so
         
well  with shared family graves  they crush the past dead relatives  so the lastest one can fit  at least that is how it works here in brazil  with my family grave  i have seen the graveyard keepers crushing my grandpa and others deeper down so my auntie could fit

best subreddit finally back
as a fellow graveyard digger worked for 1 year  i can say that they dig the really old ones up and if human remains are to be found they just dig a little deeper and put them there  normally a priest should be there and the authorities should be noticed  this is still the way for some villages even today

clickbait
have not watched pewds in a good while  probably from shortly after he moved to japan  does this video seem a tad bit off to anyone else  he seems like he is tryna force jokes and the editing is  odd  look at the way the facecam sits over the pink border  and on top of that there is a small error at the top of the bar where you see through it  did sive get fired or something lol  i mean no disrespect  just seemed strange  he also seems like he aged a shit ton  looks a lot more like his dad w those glasses too  hope he are not too stressed

you know pewds is going to be a great dad when he finds  creative  ideas on how to be a dad in cursed comments reddit 
these very funny videos are waaaay too short   d
i recommend you to watch oompaville nicokado avocado collab video

am i high or does his chair look like bonnie from fnaf

classic stuff  but it is good
        
love this series

sive s editing is sooooooo good
as a fellow dutch man my toilet is normal
for a good laugh  use the arrow keys to skip forward at 9 45 as he says link
when you catch a cold  you gain a new superpower  antigravity  people around feel the sudden urge to pull away from you at the first sneeze or cough  the downside is that while under the condition  you become weaker with each use 
play resident evil 4 pewds 
the old pewdiepie is back
   
      
i came when i clinched whoops
can anyone confirm if you can move your pp without clenching your butthole  i cannot differentiate
i enjoyed this video so much  and i i can t wait for you and maritza to be parents  
right now i am contemplating my choice to watch this while having breakfast
currently upload schedule is much better  getting excited for more pewds vids again when they re less frequent
anyone else vote pewdiepie goes through his full workout
after a 100 years they just dig up the grave and sell the plot to someone else because after 100 years everyone in the family is all ready dead
g e k o l o n i s e e r d 
            
we not going to talk about the picture in his messages at 4 47 
pewds please react to cs2 
i give this channel 2 more years 
there s a jewish cemetery near my house that do put the caskets vertical  it s fine and all but they happen to be on a super steep hill next to a road and once when there was a massive rain storm the ground softened and the caskets were heavy enough to slip through the mud and spill out onto the road
made me clench my butthole  thanks

pewdiepie  is retired  also pewdiepie  sorry i have not uploaded much lately
don t know about rest of the world but in italy graves are emptied after 100 years and what s left is put in an ossuary
we have those toilets in our country  it is so you can look at your poop before you flush it down because depending on how your poop looks you can get several informations about your digestive system and the quality of the food you where eating  if the poop is too liquid or sticky then you did not eat enaugh solid things and or fiber  if the poop is too solid and clumps up to little balls then you are slightly dehydrated   if the poop has weird color or still undigested parts in it you would have improvements if you eat fermented stuff like sauerkraut or kimchi  in fermented food there is bacteria which will support your digestive system  giving you the ability to even digest corn which you would usually poop out still with yellow color   if you eat sauerkraut then you will not poop out yellow corn because you break it up and get the nutrians  ideal poop is firm  solid but not rock hard  light brown and does not stick to the toilet bowl  this is when you know you are healthy and happy because you eat good quality food and you can be proud of your wonderful body for making such beautiful waste   d
pewdiepie is it ok if i make a statue a few with mrbeast shaking hands
hello
the cursed content has returned  never been happier in my cursed life          
                     
marzia def had the baby lol that s why he be busy and lagging it to post    
        
yes
        
same as mine
pewds i think you have done this vid already
this proves that pewds does not watch oompaville  oompaville
its been a while i got to laugh on this channel  it was nice  d
          
his smom is 20  i am 20 on my second year of college thank god for normality 
 
hey poods you still visit moncraft
why tf did you wave at me i was expecting brofist
thanks for your service
pewds uploading once in a while is like a holiday 
this video was killer  have not laughed in so long  thank you 
dead bodies can be exhumed after a long while  making more space for new ones  i am not entirely sure where those bodies go afterwards  but cemetaries do need to make space for new bodies like that  at least where i live  it is like cities skylines 
         
 ruined
that toilet is designed specifically for inspecting your poop before flushing it  there is a plate for it in the back so it stays solid and dry for inspection  i mean if that is you are thing 
lol i did not clench
3 30 well a lot of people get cremated or at least not necessarily buried professionally lol
               
cool
             
wow    
          
loud disturbing sad music confuses me so much
what is that cream on his forehead   
finally the cursed video
      
as a graveyard digger i approve of this message
2 00 as another fellow dutchman  i can confidently say that i have never had this happen to me  i have never heard of it aswell
wait till pewds finds out about oompaville
we miss this pewds so much
5 10 as an indian it always confused me why do western countries do not consider milk as vegetarian  what do you do to the cows after milking them    
vegetarians can consume milk  vegans do not consume anything that is a animal product
i almost cried laughing
fake bumpfist for the title  about the dutch toilet  it leaves marks when the porcelain is dry must have been a new toilet picture  nice headphones  makes you look more serious now 
i feel like they lay bodies down when buried because of the superstition that they will not rest well in the afterlife otherwise 
did you hear  he is getting back on the horse and going to start making videos  yaaa  now  not frequently but casually  which i am happy to hear  it makes sense because he is going to have a baby soon  and he needs the money in the future  i am glad glad he is coming back 
i had a hamster when i was young  she started bulking up  broke out of her cage  and was missing for years until we found what we think was her skeleton in a hole in the backyard 
          
we really are running out of places to bury people  more people need to be cremated or something  
              
      
dutch toilets are cursed  the mannequin comment was pretty funny though  great video pewds 
 whoever reading this  do not give up  hustle everyday 
i laughed too hard at the mannequin one
please have more than one child
hmmmmmm working on stuff  we will see
b sta  men det  r dags att bes ka sven snart  han bor i en helt ny v lr felix och du l ter honom uppt cka den sj lv  sk ms < 3
as a fellow dutchman  i think one of the main perks of being a parent is laughing at the child 
as a fellow dutchman  i agree 
yess
   
the  manequeen  made me laugh 
do not apologize future papa pewds  
felix  ma ne kwin
wow have not watched a ppie video in ages   hes really gone downhill huh 
i wish i could be as famous as you   
those toilets are actually recommended by doctors so you can keep better track of your stool   backslapping rarerely occurs   anal backsplash on us toilets however 
cannot wait for dad pewds content
as a fellow bussy owner  i can say that i too clenched my butthole 
this is the same guy who recommended berserk to a bunch of kids  you are a grown man recommending rape anime to children but you keep getting away with this shit
it is fine
                    
pewds is slowly but steady turning into john lennon 
the chaos of this video is oddly nostalgic
aw the video ends too fast  still  thanks for the upload pewds 
take your time daddy pewds  i m here giving some watch time to that nordvpn add and waiting to renew my subscription with your code to support 
 
thanks pewds yet another cursed video   been a while 
         
felix please continue your series in subnautica   you have a lot to exlpore yet  you are far away from beating the game
you can hear felix getting a new accent from speaking japenese  
i watched the ads   the end because i enjoy pewds videos    
oompaville is trying his best to keep nick alive  it does look like he is making progress in his weight loss and the more they hang out he drops the clown act and is actually pretty funny when he is himself  proud of both those bois
  earthly wizard  4 50  is a screenshot from a recent oompaville video fam  and pewds made a comment on how nik had not made any progress  just wanted to she would some light on the progress being made
i watched the sponsor part even though its at the end   it ia nt much but its honest work
to everyone  pls keep pushing in life and never give up  cannot wait to see you successful one day and may god bless you

based
you do not put people vertically in cemetaries because as they decompose the body will collapse in on itself  it is not very respectful lol  by all means cremate or go back to mausoleums if space is an issue 
skyrim 
yayyyy one of my favorite type of video
woah based dad
thanks pewdiepie you are vids are great
pewds getting a stich from laughing  put me in stitches  
looking good felix looking good   
we need more cursed comments videos  
            
          
dutch people are from the netherlands so if you want to ban dutch people you are never ever allowed to visit the nether again in your life
pewdiepie cure reddit content is the best
hey pewds i would like to see more reddit video pls make it happen
un subscribed sorry
          
6 24 god da  it
         
when i was 7 i threw my hamster against a wall

dutch oven  dutch toilet  garbage   
pewds mastered the art of apologizing in advance after that fateful day on a bridge
never fo3ger  
what happened 
 burgundy an unfortunate situation 
you all forgot fiverr moment already  
 thefateexecutioner2169 we forgive people  plus  it was several years ago  he took genuine responsibility if i recall correctly too and was not ill intended  just reckless  he is a different person now  he is matured  we do not hold onto negative feelings towards him over that  because it does not benefit anyone  
 burgundy v the bridge incident happen  when pewdiepie in heated moment say n word when playing pubg on a bridge map 
 karisuagl6212 thank you
             
i never laughed so much
     
is the baby going to watch cocomelon 
okay  hear me out  with fop my penis would literally be hard as a rock
love those himmler glasses  pewds 
 
the cursed classic 
pewdiepie  i always look forward to seeing you are videos keep doing what you do 
 
             
love you pewds 
do lwiay
usually hamsters die coz owners think they die all of a sudden and they get buried alive while they are hibernating
the crazy part about fop is that if they hit a part of their body on something whatever that is injured or shocked turns to bone
          
old families in new york stack their loved ones  
              
6 14 got me clenching my butthole too  and i do not even have a benis  
 3 06 ayyo what 
i am worried that when the baby comes  pewds is going to announce his actual retirement
the moment i saw that toilet i thought  those poor dutch people that do big shits 
it is my birthday today   this video is a funny way to start my day  
 i cannot wait to be a father  you can legally terrorize someone  i cannot wait for you to be a father xdxdxd
                 
6 11
            
hacker man fop series
thank god pewds beat t series
when i was in greece in 2018 on zakynthos  i was told the dead were buried in plots for the burial religious reasons but dug up a year later to be cremated and make room for new corpses  yep  vertical burials might have been helpful 
some cemeteries will either expand the plot of land they own  to make more room  or recycle graves  if they run out of room
           thease were my emoji  lol 
        
my buddy said the upright coffin idea a few years back   said it was the best method for christains  so tbey can launch directly at heaven when the rapture comes    
can you give me ipad 4gen please  
no need to apologize  this was hilarious xd thanks for making me laugh today 
imagine having 100  million followers
imagine having 111m followers
ooo nice to see this type of video again from pewds  always a treat these days 
uhh            
honestly so refreshing to see a  normal  pewdiepie video after a while 
master oogway is a tortoise not a turtle  so plastic straws can t defeat him
 
           4 24
4 47   what is that image
             
people do not have any jewish frinds   those cemeteries exist 
4 49 you want him to be dead  edit  4 59 i guess so
so glad to see this series again
 
i missed this
         
support group for all the fop googlers
how old are you
zach from the try guys has fop
we have less serial killers because they are all being hired by the people that committed jeffery epstein s suicide 
                              
uk they can put upto 3 coffins on top of each other in a grave 
i wanted to do the emoji pattern thing and i got two girls on weed                  
number of views   buttholes clenched
bro you are the best made me laugh    
6 21 bruh i got played ngl
rainbow six tons 
pewds sound disappointed nikocado still trying to kill himself
3 02 protip or protein 
good shit
i clenched my butt and i m a female     
have not seen pewdiepie react to curse comments in a long time  old memories  
we love you pwds no matter what you do
2 00 as a fellow dutchman  i can tell you  grandma s all have blue tiles on the restroom walls with catchy slogans like  not all pp time is poopoo time but all poopoo time is pp time 
the  bag slapper  is probably the funniest thing i have ever heard of 
i would rather you have fun doing  other stuff  than have to feel like you owe us an upload  you have got a great life  go out and enjoy it  
literally just saw what felix looks like when he clenches his butthole
well fop is a little good because you become more invincible to falls  but still rigidity is a curse for sure
               
fun fact  your butthole is always clenched  squeezing it actually opens it up
i do not think i will ever get over felix saying  top of the cream  instead of  cream of the crop  lmao
           
pewds should change the channel name to felix kjellberg
pews looking more like indian pewdiepie the more he ages 
new editors
hi pewds my mom loved to turn fairy tales into horror stories to scare us forever  we love her and always make her tell her horror stories to our family
              
watch out for nikocado he means business i bet he is going to make an hour long video over this
you look different for some strange reason
fuck   please do not tell me not to google something because i will evreytime  now i cannot unsee fop  thanks felix
          
someone make a compilation of all of the quotes pewds has made about  when i m a parent  or  if i had a kid   i think it would be both wholesome and cursed
          
mew
it is surprising how much interesting and actually really good videos can be found on p sites seemingly out of random  i was going through one once  and found an amazing edit of disney fantasia  2000 the firebird or whatever one  and again  pretty much out of random 
who is editing this 
       
maybe i am smart afterall> got me
in nola we bury people above ground  not to prevent flooding like some folks think  but once the body is in there  the summer heat turns it to ash in those things  so  the tombs get swept out and another body put in 
if dutch people shat on the toilet like butters from south park they d be fine  even got a shelf for their book
jews bury their dead upright  which is why their cemeteries are so tightly packed 
has pewds spoken about the twitch channel running infinite videos yet  was wondering if it is really him because that would be quite disappointing if it is true  
when the sonic part happened i went ayyyyoooo
if people hating on you for not uploading they do not understand what it is like to have someone who is in the beginning stages of pregnancy  it takes your time away from a lot fo things  doc appointments  meds  and other things that could happen  do not stress  take your time  to all you nine year olds wait till you get married you will understand   
cringe
  s ren junkers  what is cringe is people who habe anime as their pic  thier the ones who need a poster with half naked hinata to tell you to shower  i have been to conventions
so  i missed it  twitch hacked or not hacked 
this 9 52 vids are so short   we need atleast an hour  maybe like once a week  kind
first 3 hours yess  keep it going bro  
          
is not it  that is the cream of the crop  yea 
i laughed so hard at this video   you just made men around the world clench their ass  that killed me  thank you for this
             
so what you are saying is that the next season of  scare pewdiepie  will actually involve mini pewds  genius  big brain 
its grave diggers they dig your graves not the place where their is already a grave
from what i know they either move the coffins after some time further away or they make new graveyards  i went camping with a friend and we realized we had been camping on top of an old graveyard 
so when man moves pee pee  it s like a kegal   
babe wake up  new pewdiepie video dropped
i bought nord vpn 
upvote this comment  if you clenched your butt too 
help me out of my problem please  
ayooooooogh
hallo
when we get old pewdiepie back
pewdi  wen is baby come from marsia  date tell pls 
please start minecraft hardcore series again 
meanwhile sive 4 is dead of starvation because pewds has not been paying him 
i am so happy that you are back   i was just thinking today about how i miss coming home and watching your videos  but that was so long ago and you are about to have a family  and i m an adult now  it is so crazy how life changes  but it is still so refreshing to watch your videos  can t wait to see more  
                  
pewds is back the man the legend
after so long  we have an edgy video from pewds
damn      
i wonder if large youtube channels like pewdiepie will become a family business like when pewdiepie dies his kid takes over the channel and so on 
         
the dutch bag slapper comment had me lmao   
xd
felix what brand of foundation do you use
 the top of the cream  lol
i miss pweds but honestly  i cannot get any happier for him 
man i missed you t t
i lived in the netherlands for two years and can verify the bagslapper is a real experience
reddit review just gives me a whole new level of serotonin
i know the baby is a girl 
as a dutch person  i do not know where they got that toilet from  but it is not from us  at least not in the majority of holland 
i remember my little hamster named eddie little bro tried giving him a bath 
pewds give us more gaming videos ya feckin beast of a sandwich    
i lost my shit at dutch bag slapper  i am legitimately dead  this is my obituary  10 10
          
after all these years of watching i get banned for being dutch  
did you know  in america  congress is trying to restrict our rights to  foreign adversaries  it basically says in small print if we try to go against it  utilizing vpns that help us view the internet in a different country  then there is a fine and imprisonment as a result  so everytime i see your ad for nordvpn i am like    its not a law but there is talk about our government restricting us  the  tik tok ban  is a front to try to pass this bill 
hey it is your account on twitch you  that pewdiepie infinity    
 james stuart hate to burst your bubble but i am not a child
yoooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo
hahha this is wholesome    
bruh   in poland i used a dutch toilet and it wiped my ass on timber like a sharpie   i was traumatized 
the editing for this video s flow is off pewdiepie and the editor seem out of synch with his humor 
pewdiepie getting cancelled  it is just another tuesday that nick fury mom and a lamborghini though xd
thank you pewds for making us clench our buttholes in unison
no  you didn t say the n word again  did you 
what is that background piano music  i have been on the hunt for years 
you know pewds getting comfortable when he comes back to this subreddit
pewds   i apologize you for advance  everyone   we forgive you   pewds   but you don t know   everyone   we forgive you  
yes
i cannot believe he is already apologizing truly a pewdiepie s foresight 
that pimple is cursed
top of the cream indeed
k  goodbye
the dutch toilet is my favorite 
someplace rent out plots and after so many years they dig up the body and put a new one down  usually by then the old body is just dust and clothes
do not do it pewds lol
long live the top g
 i can move my pp without clenching my butt  is that not normal  call science 
      
<3
what i learned this video  dutch people are f ing wild 
as a fellow dutchman  i do not approve of those toilets and have not heard the phrase bag slappers before  i am now scared of those toilets  
seems like pewds started shaving with real razors  he is really growing up now
your headset is ugly and weird felix    
cool
i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard while reading the bag slapper comment  there is tears streaming down my face  i am a complete mess  damn that was so fucking funny 
miss laughing like that  been a min  i am glad you can experience that still
what caused me to tear up was reading about the medic impregnating a soldier with baboon embryos  made me lose my mind for a solid half hour 
   
do not apologize about making videos  we enjoy them  but your child and wife are more important  remember  financial security can buy you time which can never be bought back if you are working all the time  can we get a gaming video soon  for old time s sake  sounds fun bro 
      
please do not call marzia a horse  kind of rude
can felix talk about his twitch   people are so confused there on who is streaming  if it is hacked or not   he never says anything about streaming there   help them felix  
            
can move pee pee without butthole to set the record straight 
cool nord vpn i cannot wait to try right after the  restrict act  is passed in america  what  i am going to get 20 years in prison for using a vpn  cool 
maybe i watched this on 1x instead of 2x  but he sounds so much older in this video     
miss this vibe sm
6 15 bro fist to all that tried
 i do not want dutch toilet  i prefer shitting in the shower at the gym with my bro   pewds
i just watch this yesterday   the old version its really good
finally  senpai has returned  youtube has been going downhill for me since you began uploading less frequently  there is nothing fun to watch anymore 
         
nordvpn must have double the bag this time if pewds gave them 2 minutes of ad time
 that is the top of the cream    got to love it   
that is 59million income yeaayy
you have come and gone  was a good run  its done now  time to move on  does not mean you cannot put out good content
is this a repost  cuz i feel like i have watched this like 2 years ago or something
          
why do not you wear your wedding ring anymore 
pewdiedad is going to be the most based reaction channel on youtube
no way  i was just binge watching all of his previous cursed comments videos  lets effin go gamers   got to keep it family friendly for the kids working at youtube 
6 03 use straws from avocado seeds
nikocado avocado  s seeds 
felix getting hurt from laughing is the most relatable thing
                     
its ok pewds we all love you pewdiepie
we all forgive you
pewds said not to look up  fop  so i did not  i am going to trust you on this one pewds

please  men it will be great to you to  come back  
you re working so hard  may all your wishes come true
okay i need more cursed comments videos
      
the toilets in the nether lands are reversed  makes sense 
talking about m ster oogway there is a guy named masteroogwgay  he is great check his vids
hilarious
pewdiepie is inspiration my channel  keep spirit 
as a fellow dutchmen  i can tell you the reason our toilets have this little plateau is so you can watch your poop before you flush  look if anything looks wrong with it and perhaps tell if you are sick 
                             
work hard until you do not have to stretch df out of you are vedios   i forgive you in advance  
love cursed comments x

xoxo   pewdiepie and the fam  
the dutch toilets are old one s  they are not that commen anymore

pp
                                         
i remember someone telling me that after 20 years or so the tomb gets removed to make space in a graveyard  do not know if its true though
thanks bro  i hope everything is going well with the pregnancy  much love to you both    
imagine dying with that bone disorder  in a compromising position

one plastic straw took out a whole flock of turtles during the making of this video  also  fop 
                     
no need to apologize papa felix

6 20 man
yooo  i ve never heard it anywhere else  but i used to steal at least 50 a day from the register at mcdonald s  it s so easy  i m glad someone else did it as well  you just have to give coupons out while taking the cash
              
funny how his setup changed from a casual gamer to an old peoples library lol 
yo i am low key waiting for these grocery store vegans to get their ass kicked in public  minus the low key part

the fkin nick fury joke had me rolling lmao
 i cannot wait to be a dad  and this put a smile to my face  their kid will have one of a heck life lol
probably will become an insufferable spoiled brat if they are not careful with money 
except the part where japan is quite racist and the child might be ostracised or bullied for not being japanese
 ollep0lle nahh
  ollep0llethe guy is going to be white it is okay    he is ginna have it better than any brown person
  ollep0lle i do not want to make bold assumptions but i am pretty sure felix has a lot of money  he can easily enroll his child to some private international school with other rich foreign kids 
the mods on cc subreddit  are a bunch of immature manchilds ngl
  ollep0llethe child is going to have that white privilege card  no need to worry 
he will a miserable racist just like this coward racist hiding away in japan
  ollep0lle lol it is quite the opposite  they treat foreigners like some kind of treasure there
 zserlpq8512 it wpuld be the best if the lid grew up like he and marzia did  like a normal family which i believe they will be cuz both of them are level headed as faras i m concerned  i just don t want the lid to turn out like a spoiled rich brat and richy schools like that are filled with them
 come over and see  the  audio  recording where  amber heard  almost died 
g dragon king  
maybe if they move to another country because japan is complete sh t

 oliver 04 the title i think
  racheluriah  what a fucking   nigge 
g dragon king  
sive editing getting crazier the less he edits for pewds  i love it  quality over quantity is better for me 
him still doing this kind of shvt is srsly impressive  
this is cursed
gawd daaamn  harry potter look different than from what i remember
does felix not know about the whole oompaville and nikokado friendship if not then he should react to the entire story it is the best thing of all time
god i love these videos so much  miss them 
          
thank you very much
welp  i am banned now  goodbye guys
the durch toilet is a sleeper  no chance at poseidon s kiss when poopin  just saying 
someone needs to tell him his twitch got hacked
bro i clenched my ass too 
4 50 pewds  bro   that is your old friend caleb oompaville   he has been collaborating with nickacado and even that vegan teacher  where you been  i mean what the hell you do not even keep up with youtube  you got a life in some interesting foreign country  mr   i have got the biggest pp because i can afford to be a gaijin  is better than us losers who rely on people like you and oompaville to make life worth living  we get it  you are better than me  just say it 
i work at a funeral home  while they don t have people vertically at cemeteries  what they do to save space  instead is stack people up  basically  you buy rent a plot for your grandpa  but then there s space for grandma and uncle jim when they die too  or if you don t have that many relatives  you can also sublet the space to a stranger if you like  usually it s three people to a grave  but you can fit four at a pinch depending on how the health regulations are done 
yup it is the best time to get crypto and participate in this freecoins me  give away
i received 16btc from freecoins me    i will definitely sell half of it to buy tickets for trip around the world  thanks so much
my favorite is when you laugh  your butthole laughs with you 
it makes me feel a really good sense of calm watching your videos now  it is coming from just knowing how far you have come and how you have evolved your content with you and still never lost your unique charm  really graceful growth  gg s 
i would not ask you to video document your young family but i beg you to paraphrase your devious  fatherly shenanigans and relay them to us  
nice harry potter glasses pewds  
fun facts   your eyes can see your nose yet your brain decide to ignore it  you brain  bones and most of your organs are wet  it is quite possible to be buried  alive  there was a point in your life where you were the youngest person on earth 
pov when you move on the other side of the earth but still release the video at the same time of the day  notification at 1 a m  me  i guess that enough sleep time to go to work
as another fellow dutchman i have to say  if you have a particularly big turd  your balls will get what we call a  modderbad  or mudbath in english  it is said to bring good luck
brasil

i am pretty sure celine dion has stone man syndrome

111 mil subs youtuber camera level 04 45
with the 10k from the register he must have pocketed a little bit each day and the store must not have kept a good inventory so the business had no idea it was missing any money
and the  phenomenon  struggle continues
back to his roots
      
finally a video without ken
dude i really love your videos   miss them so much 
imagine  a retired guy apologizes for not uploading frequently  what a legend 
always enoyable to watch pewds going through a subreddit 
finally  a video i enjoy   
try having lupus and then because of it having your leg amputated 
pewds  are you aware of the twitch stream running on your old channel 
i am a fellow swede   my father had a store with a life size clown doll that he told the family he got rid of   what he instead did was to put it in my sisters bed which she found when she was going to sleep  she still hates clowns 20 years later   thank you dad 
felix  how thick  your glasses 
    
what kind of glasses is pewds wearing 
do you think serial killers start out with a plan to do things that make people give them a cool name
love the zelda reference 
   
damn  thanks for the laughs  i needed that today
i am dutch and i am not apologizing 
pewd cannot wait for avocado to die  is he still around  lolwat 
i am pretty sure after a long time they dig out graves and bury other people  some families bury their family members on top of each other 
           
        
      
5 10  this confuses me so much  it s not like it s cruel to milk a cow so what are they accomplishing here 
it does harm the cows i also used to think that until i hear about american views factories
i didn t know beefier  but the cows have to be pregnant for the entire time they are producing milk  and they are stuck in crammed conditions for their entire life  sounds pretty crappy 
first
                           
we stay for the spon  
is nordvpn open source 
vida longa a quem leu essa mensagem  
my hamster died from suffocating itself sleeping in a ball in its food bowl
quem concorda que o pewdiepie   o melhor youtuber 
we can all agree this video was too short
we missed gaming week pewdiepie 
i never thought boi woild return
we dig graves horizontally because we d rather be lazy than efficient 
i m happy for you and marzia  
yes hes back
 let us ride nick fury  is crazy   
this videos edits are wild  who edited this  twomad 
you know too much 
we do stack bodies in cemeteries  not every where but a lot of places just stack dead people on top of each other to save space
are dutch toilets the next t series  
now i regret being dutch
god bless you everybody welcome to ecuador   
my hamster hung himself 
felix is a swedish viking dad in japan so he is basically a real life anime character 
 aaaaaa
as a dutch person i would like to confirm the statement made about the  bag slappers  in dutch   zak klappers  and i would like to state that it is also widely used by dutch men for research purposes 
nee dat is alleen maar amsterdam
as a dutch person i am going to
if you are happy  it is all fine 
i am not buying my moms left eye wtf 
vamos curtir o v deo galera pra ajudar o felix 
thanks for the journey throughout the years pewds   you are history
 i made a funny video about a woman crying over her dead dog lmfao    
o
if my mom s left eye cost 29mil  i definitely would not buy it 
my pattern is                
finally
all is forgiven pewds  
what
i am dutch and now i am sad  
technically fop is a superpower  you can turn into stone  you just cannot undo the transformation 
i rarely get got  but bag slappers got me    
upload as much as you want  i ll keep watching volume or not
old skool pewds is bak woot
hello
 i are not a furry but  is crazy  
its been a while were getting a 10 minute vid 
what the fuck dutch  i am going to visit indonesia next month  better not have your toilet over there 
this was a great video   and my last one apperantly  i am dutch 
as a loyal fan and dutchman  i feel offended
dude looking for that manscapped sponsorship   
the penis flexing butt closing thing is kind of funny   funfact you have a refelx where if you pinch the glans penis clitoris the sphincters in the butt contract  the bulbocavernosus reflex  doctors use this to assess spinal shock or spinal cord injuries in trauma patients by sticking their finger in the patients butt and then pinching the glans penis clitoris to feel if the sphincters have a normal muscle tone  and yes this feels as weird to do as it sounds 
dutch people are dropping harrington s  that is why 
so many bots
where that resident evil 4 remake at 
apology rejected
no twitch link in bio  now i m confused
as a fellow dutchman  i can say that having experienced this toilet at least you re preventing your butt from being splashed with water from dropping your doodoo in the toilet  nothing worse than splashes against your butt  however  i am banned now  so long gamers 
  inexplic vel a energia boa que o pewdiepie nos transmite   
um grande verdade 
nigga
i am dutch and have never seen these toilets 
those emojis were top notch 
e mais uma vez o pewdiepie chegando pra alegrar nossas noites    quem concorda   
 i made a funny video about a woman crying over her dead dog lmfao    
watched a doc on fop over a decade ago  it is really awful  the people have to decide if they want to be in a sitting oe standing position for the rest of their life  one guy was frozen in a lying down standing position so his carer would have him strapped into what looked like a trolley for moving boxes  so he could be pushed around upright 
good video  good times  akanbo itsu 
love from india from kerala by asim               
          
8 08 gaming month 23 confirmed 
no but for real you got to decide between the bag slapper or the splasher  splashers are like 10x more common  i am taking the dutch toilet
seems like pewds is feeling at home again in this subreddit 
e
funny enough there is a serial killer who was nicknamed  the weepy voiced killer  because he called the cops after hi crimes   cried like a baby on the phone 
great video      
nah we enjoy cursed comments videos
2 00 so that s what that is called   thank you for your contribution people of the land of the dutch   
seeing frizzable caught me off guard
mr beast > pewdiepie  
pewds going back to an amazing and interesting subreddit
pewds we need re4 remake
barely above 5 mins bro what is this a video for ants
as a fellow dutch person  we have the knowledge to set a backslap curse upon anyone  caution with who you ban  
4 11 ok he asked for now all artists unite and make fursona for pewds
artists unite
apologise in advance   what did you do   kekw  these cursed comments are something  least they made for humourous commentary comebacks  danke for the humour  hope your doing well  keep being awesome   safe bro      
               
10k over 3 years is nothing how petty
schiet mijn taart    
         danielle plaidcashew
laughed a lot on this one
cursed 
hehe
they probably do not put the bodies in the ground vertically because they would have to dig the holes to different depths for different people all the time  i am 6 8  better get that excavator ready 
guys  is that true   seems weird 
i guess he does not realize how stupid he looks like when he is laughing to himself then his little room and thinks so if i laugh then millions of people will laugh with me  talk about a narcissist 
i apologize in advance for becoming a famous rapper
i am dutch  the toilet story is true   it does rarely happen though  9 10 times it instead stops poseidons kisses so its quite good  
i am not a furry but it is the first statement put out by someone that is about to become furry
dude frank crawling out of the toilet at 2 37 has me dying  
    
dw bro i just need 3 cycle semi log graph in excel how to do 
pewds if you do not pin you are mom gae
 it actually requires a lot of accuracy  legend
loeeeeee
early
01 04 everyfuckingyear is hust a tsunami of bullshit   let us gooo
this video s editing style does feel pretty different and fresh from other pewd s videos
i absolutely adore cursed comments  cuz there are black humor gems all around xd so your review of this subreddit is like a dream came true   i do not think fibrodysplasia looks that cursed  it is actually really interesting  how new bones were building up on top of the regular skeleton  like shield plates  there was a man with this disease  who donated his skeleton after his death for research  or something like that  and it looks absolutely dope  surely  it is a horrible disease  but not that visually cursed in comparing to some other subjects 
book review after this 
lol
you should go to the japan meet of furries or kemocon  i mean i would  i like the japan furry culture much more than western furries  much more fun and in character  most of them act really cute too 
pewdiepie have a nipping again  classy to drink good whishey in japan  p
thanks  i hate it
pewds is back to his normal habitat 
hola ay alguien ay en espa old 
mi no pablo spanisho
i was about to google fop until you said not to  thank you for saving me from another untold internet horror  pewds  i have seen things you would not believe but i do not need to go out of my way to see more 
r you wearing the make up 
  
let us ride nick fury lmaoo
bruh his reaction after trying to move his pp
haha  du har b rjat bryta p  italienska   pdp has begun to speak with an italian accent on top of the swedish  soon he will sound like mario 
happy friday  god bless everyone and love you all  to anyone who reads this  make sure you know jesus christ as your lord and saviour everyone  he is coming soon  do not be left behind  accept and believe in jesus christ  john 3 16  revelation 20 15  1 corrinthians 15 1 4  romans 10 9 and 10  ephesians 2 8 and 9 jesus loves you 
you are still a thing huh
the fact that the  this is just a joke  text scrolls everytime he makes a joke is just sad  who are these dumbasses like  what  he told me to eat my sister  bully  he is bad person  what the hell people 
i feel at a conendrum as a dutch person  i would like to explain dutch toilets but i am banned lol
hey pewds  just wanted to say your the reason i started making videos so thank you so much and your videos are awesome and i am so happy for you and marzia on the baby
hello daddy
                  
pewdiepie doing a nightly upload it says rare as kanye west not pissing someone off  
bag slapper sounds like a nightmare d 
a retired youtuber giving us more content than actual youtubers out there  i love this dude   he should collab with felix kjailbreak though i mean kjellberg
its impossible for him to ruin this sub because it has not been funny since 2020
hopefully pewds gets back to streaming just like 2020
dutch people just be sitting like butters told us to
as a fellow dutchman  i can confirm the back slapper
i cannot wait for reddit review with baby pewds
                  
he may not acknowledge it but the reason he said he never thought of that is because he definitely tried lifting his penis or because they do happen at the same time every time
love you felix
<3
         
i was just chilling  relaxing with my feet up and then i hear this agitating noise going on about banning the dutch  which  fair but wow  agressive much  jk  but if you want to know  it is made that way so we can check our poop as health indicator
i always love your videos  you can take time and upload whenever you want
hello  fellow grave digger here  when you shove someone in the oven and they reach a light rost the remains drop down to a second burner   while ya boy s cooking down there you can insert a new fellow  you do that a few times  and when your body is nthn but bones  a cool dude comes with his bucket and pulls the finished one out   he then goes mayham on the bones with a magnet to a  pulverize the bones and b   get all the metals from the coffin  all the fun things you had in your body like prosthetics  hope this helped
thank you pewds for making us clench our buttholes in unison
literally did it unconsciously   gosh dang it ahahahaha
 i made a funny video about a woman crying over her dead dog lmfao    
i do food reviews while i m high on my youtube channel 
lmao
my gf and i just argued until i told her to try

  lovingjudas ayo

last one reminds me of the time my partner and i got custom coraline dolls of ourselves  watched coraline with the kids  then the next day put them on the sofa  called the kids in  and hid   pure chaos 
chatgpt gave me some examples  one of them was  there are more planes in the ocean than submarines in the sky 
yessss the reaction subreddit videos     we missed that
i like to think of pewds as that cool uncle of youtube now  seen everything and done it all  and now he rests by the campfire to tell some stories 
i never believed you  but now i am definitely certain that felix schellbearg from the vlogs and pewdiepie are not the same person
i m seeing a severe lack of the sonic 2 movie on xvideos
lol dutch bag slapper
all is forgiven
excited for the day pewds and his child can enjoy reviewing a subreddit together   
that day will never come to be honest
 i made a funny video about a woman crying over her dead dog lmfao    
if they do not shield their kid from the internet  he she is going to be majorly messed up in the head  classic celebrity kid stuff 
when that day comes i will feel old
i miss pewdiepie streaming  i used to watch literally every stream like 2 years ago  remember that one where he was playing his own weird p00p game 
love the video pewds  i laughed so hard at this lmao
i ve been led to believe that autism could be an exception to   7 12
8 min video damn
friday s with pewdiepieeeeeeee
hey pewds  i noticed you apologized in your title   i just wanted to drop a comment and let you know that i m a bit of an apology expert  myself   if you re ever in need of my services or advice  don t hesitate to reach out   i ve apologized publicly over 40 times  and am achieving great returns with my forgiveness rate   thanks  and i m sorry 
 i ve apologized 40  times and still the world won t forgive me  maybe with pewdz help  i could finally achieve world forgiveness      trever farted  quite the flip from this comment you left 3 days ago  
 gigiruffa i ll address these accusations in an apology video  soon 
first
love you pewds  happy to see more of your classic content  d
thank you for the apology  
                 
if you actually care to maybe consider someone is feelings you would see that nick is on a pretty good redemption arc as of lately i personally do not see how making a humorous video with him would not be something pewdiepie would want to do
 
i have not seen that fast scrolling text disclaimer in so long 
i don t forget  i don t forgive
i cannot unsee the shrek one omg  
why did i not listen to pewds and search what fop was anyway  
should start each video with   hey son 
too short twt
it is ok  we love you 
my comment would have been a cursed one but i am not that drunk yert

as a fellow dutchman  i am sorry pewds
pewds will you meeting me at disney world yes or brofist or big pp
is that english 
diez minutos  0
welcome to platform pewdie
i will not be banned 
as a fellow dutchman  i can say that whoever made that toilet should be sent straight to hell  my schools all had them like that 
  but why  why did they make that toilet  i do not understand why anyone thought it was a good idea 
i am still looking at the picture and not really understanding the problem  could someone explain  lmao
  rambleon07 this toilet prevent your butt cheeks from riding the wave when your poop splash the water  
 rambleon07 so you do not get poseidons kiss
so you can look at your archievement
i will forever value pewds words of wisdom  thank you  felix  for giving me the courage to eat my sister
ayo let me on on that
i love the soundtrack of this youtube video  definitely someone new editing video audio
f s in the chat for all the dutch people who can no longer watch pewds  content 
thank you so much 
wooo
it s okay
4 48 ah yes the new 8k
  how tf did you get your hands on paramount war
definitely not me instantly realizing you live in jp and it s probably a million times easier to get a booster box
as a fellow dutchman i have to say   everything about the toilet is true
i imagine it prevents neptune s kiss  almost worth the trade off  but i could not inflict that on the men of the world 
 i made a funny video about a woman crying over her dead dog lmfao    
sometimes you have to jiggled a little to get it to fall down
why do you even have that shitty design to begin with
i have never heard of it
as a fellow dutchman  this never happened to me but the toilets are still better because they do not splash your ass
how do you slap your balls with a turd like you want to play baseball  it never happened to me  maybe drink water next time or any liquid though the day so it will not go hard  that toilet was made so we do not have to get neptunus kiss  and you still complain 
hahah yesss  hallo kameraad haha 
pretty sure it was invented so you can check what comes out for medical reasons  you would not at all be able to see if there was blood in your shit if it just falls down into a hole  pretty smart i am going to  but also gross      
 thedutcheagle  precies die  liever deze toilet dan die water plonsers 
as a fellow dutchman  i always believed our toilets are quite normal 
ik leef mijn hele leven al in nederland en ik heb deze toiletten nog nooit eerder gezien wat is hier aan de hand
 user js9nk7nc1z ooit wel is in een gemiddelde jaren 60 woning geweest 
 thethunder9991 zijn er voor zover ik weet niet echt in de buurt  tenminste niet niet bij de plekken waar ik over het algemeen naar toe ga
 kc cobra maybe a bit weird  but in my language we say poseidon s kiss lol
 niyaparvanova10 haha  that is a good one x 
  beastcrip16 that is sad not funny and what does this have to do with the comment
my grandparents had this toilet  its from the 50s 60s
i got a notification on yet and legit watched the vid right out of the shower floor gang for life 
hey oo
scaring your children might be fun but embarrassing them is even better  i enjoy pulling out the whip and nae nae in public in front of my teenagers  it s the best
i cannot wait for father s pewds

hi
pewds already plotting on how to terrorize his kid   very on brand   
                never thought it would look like this but cool i guess
i haven t watched a pewdiepie video in a year and a half  ill update you how this goes 
all these mf bot comments begging for likes are so annoying
   people might not see this comment  but everybody stay safe and have a blessed day may god be with you all      take care everyone     
chris chan is out of prison apparently  jsyk
0 26 this whole part had me dying
comment section is slow compared to mrbeast 
can you do way more videos like this without that weird bearded man  
 i pray   that whoever reads this  god heals whatever is hurting you   
babe  wakeup  pewdiepie uploaded a new video
shut up  you do not have a babe 
what happened 
ramzan mubarak to all my muslim brothers and sisters             
you have to buy your plot in the cemetery  the longer a cemetery stays open the more expensive it gets  i know some oldies from my church who bought their plots when they were in their early 30s some of those plots are now worth 6 figures or more depending on the location  this is also why cremation is getting more and more popular because you can just put ashes in a vase and leave it on a shelf instead of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars to be chucked in the ground   moral of the story  if you are looking for a new investment opportunity  rather then investing in the housing market invest in the cemetery plot market  living is temporary death is forever 
yes  but actually  being buried naturally is also possible and much easier  no need to get buried in a cemetery
when i die just throw me in the trash
you can also just scatter the ashes  no need to keep them on your living room shelf  it is a bit disturbing if you thing about it 
my friends family runs a funeral service and they make stupid money  business must be good when you always have a supply of new customers every week 
 luanmm exactly
9min vid what a suprise
reddit review is back  
         
 nothings changed huh     
some graveyards in other countries have like a rental burial ground  so they go in the ground till they decomposed then they are dug up  bones go with family and a new person is burried
i know every dude just clenched their ass  
one of my hampsters ate the  other one in his cage and 2 days later had a epileptic seizure then died of a heart attack

russian occupation forces invaded ukraine and are killing civil population  please  post this appeal to the leader of your country   we demand the introduction of strict sanctions  disconnect russia from swift  cancel russian visas  restrict all business cooperation with russia and stop exporting products to the country of aggressor  help us stop a war in europe  it has already brought many war crimes by russian army  such as massacres of civilians and their children

i cannot believe i do not watch this dude for the past 3 years now i do and he is still about his damn ass chair and the recline  this is what time travel should feel like
can we please see pewdiepie  this swedish guy keeps making videos on your youtube channel 
smash or pass minecraft mobs
yes please film more pug videos   d
4 35 could easily make advert for razor  he shave  he gains 
pewdiepie is so enjoyable to watch  even his adverts are fun 
it is been a while  being nice when you are told to is harder than stopping the war in ukraine  we could use beastmaster right now  the good old days  they hacked printers in ukraine like that one time he did it for  sub to pewds  we did not know we were training for war  i remember when elon did meme review  better guest than when ben shapiro or alex jones did  edit  i do not think alex jones did meme review  he should though  before he goes to the joint  vladmir putin meme review  too far  an indian film just passed batman like that one time an indian channel passed you  take that colonizers  indian movie rrr beats the batman and the lost city and takes the no 1 spot collecting more than  64 million in theopening weekend globally  world peace would happen if everyone bought the pewdiepie chair gah should have done that  of course  sweden is trying to join nato 
in this video i saw what pewdiepie showed me  namely nord vpn  is nord vpn good 
bladee listener chad

i am a fan since 2012  and i am indeed a 19 year old   for the next month at least  hereby i solemnly vow to support pewdiepie in his quest of youtube and i promise to come back to this channel regularly  note to future generations  protect this creator no matter how the times change 
never  you bullied dhar mann > 
seeing how much you aged and gained awesome muscle mass from when i saw you in 2014 keep up the amazing work you love doing man and have a great rest of the year man i will probably comment again later on the year
also first video i saw of you was you freaking out from slender man then killing him with a gun in that old slender man game
beard looks good on you  grow beard man

the irony of what he was saying during the arms gain but you know i had to do it to them   he says its his left arm but its his right arm    i am sorry lmao they are sweet gains though   
heart attacks at 10 13  you are welcome 
reading all the comments make me want to cry  but with happy tears    thankyou pewds  you deserve so much loves and happiness  just remember we all love you and will always be there to support you   
here is my nice thing for you pewds i don t think i  ever comment on vids so its extra super special lol i never thought that a swedish man yelling at barrels when i was a teenager would become such a great influencer you have helped more be then i think you could really even know you are amazing and by far my favorite youtuber bro fist

we do not need the full version of smash or pass  we all know felix would  frick a creeper   for new 19yos  he confessed it and some wholesome big pp owner made the most beautiful song with the audio 
is this video a bladee reference 
            
why are you deleting comments supporting ukraine  do you support russia  it seems so
do you use creatin 
hi you must have just started on youtube thing can be not as you think

the reason they go all out on gender reveal parties is because now they have more small children to torture in 4 years time in the next gender reveal party
pewds wants to smash dunkey  dunke be like huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh

pewdiepie can t lose to a baby channel   cocomelon 
it is your daily reminder that ukrainians are dying every hour to protect liberal democracy in europe 
it is definitely sad watching ignorant people having fun because they do not want to ruin their mood  i hope pewdiepie will eventually react and stop his ignorance about the war but my hopes might be aimless  he could play ukrainian video games and raise money for the because but he instead goes shopping to wish  but stay strong ukraine  we are with you  slava ukraini 
it is your daily reminder that ukrainians are dying every hour to protect liberal democracy in europe 
he should play dragon age  he would probably enjoy it 
pewds solves world peace with his chairs
it is been a long time pwediepie i am 19 now
fucker poor felix saying be nice to me be nice to batman  bye respecting his   movies and nordvpn is stupid

how da fu  do you have that much subscribe 111k
you are the best sub to piwdiepie
you live in brighton felix
who else is 19
 that is my left arm on the left  ah yes the archer team is really made out of archers people die when they are killed
when you create a video that you yourself are invested in  it really shows  we can all see how much fun you are having and it translates to the viewers  cheers my dude 
i wish this channel will live longer
try slapping your self in the head for 10 minutes and see how many views you get as an experiment i don t see why you have not done anything like this to test the channel you sort of appear like a scripted program sometimes because this can be stretched out into multiple video reviews and other people reacting to it with you reviewing their reaction and so on and so on eventually being dragged on for days or weeks therefor giving content while giving your self a break
bladee
bladee kind of trash fr
 chrisinner4285 no way pham  bladee is revolutionary

youtube feels like it s dying but then there s felix   10 years strong and still giving great content and looks way comfortable with what he s creating
so sad now that i m actually 19  pewdiepie is retiring and he s just a living memory in the back of my head   he was even my mentor who taught me english when i was 11  i learned english from watching him play happy wheels  and from there english even became my main language  no exaggeration  if i didn t see that video of him playin happy wheels  i wouldn t have ever found this amazing language and have the same charisma that i have  pewds you truly don t understand  good stuff man  loved growing up with you  love you so much   
hello my friends

i feel a little bad now for being a salty kid some years back   i left some angry comment because i did not like pewdiepie  it was silly  i am still no fan  but it was stupid to have so much hatred 
no  no soup for you 
i hardly ever comment but man  pewds has been one of the most consistent things in my life the past decade or so and i have just been thinking of when he retires  obviously all great things will end eventually  but it just makes me feel so grateful for the good times we have had together as a community  thank you felix and everyone else who has made this so amazing  obviously i will miss it when it is over but i am so happy it happened 
he still fkn does this 
pewdiepie fell off  easy facts  also cope

pewds mystery 111m subs get 3m views per video  
he was in youtube for a decade so msot of them subscribed and moved on look at t series 200 mil and 300k per video
 milkyeagle4700 i know for how long he is been on youtube i have been with him since the beginning but still looks like this channel is dying he should quit before it becomes pathetic he have no new content nor new ideas he should enjoy his life away of youtube with his family
 ninounino4552 he says he is already retired and can quit at any time he just does it for fun so as long as people still watch and enjoy him he will upload
 sic shawn yup his time is over we had fun for a decade it is time to pass the torch

i want to appeal to all americans who climb into our politics without knowing anything  the invasion of ukraine is a forced measure  the president of ukraine is an ordinary pawn that was sold to western countries and claimed to join nato  nuclear weapons were planned to be deployed near the borders of my homeland  everyone knows about the development by the americans of biological weapons in ukraine  if you are so sorry for ukraine  why did you remain silent when the families and civilians of donbass were killed by the nazis in ukraine for 8 years  it is not for you to judge us  your reputation and the number of military personnel are not small either  propaganda in your media is running high
 that is my left arm on the left  pewds
imagine saving video to watch later with food just to discover it got deleted  could not be me
i was sat enjoying the video then suddenly i get an ad about men s orgasms  wtf  
you are great felix  remember that  and holy cow  i am so proud over you with your gains  it has been so gradual to me but seeing the side by side comparison was mind boggling  stay awesome 
hey pewds i do not usualy leave coments  just leave a like and suport the chanel  but i love that you are more virsitile and you are audience loves it to  you see the feedback  you are a great chanel to wach to relax  laugh  learn and to feel inspired  just be you are self and you are audience will love you  p s  all the love from lithiuania

agenda 2030  pewds chair world peace
honestly  i don t care if it s felix looking at memes  talking about philosophy  book club  house tour  or just having fun with marzia and his pugs  i will always enjoy a pewdiepie video 
remember everyone be nice to felix  i am always nice
i like how obama is still considered a world leader to pewds ahahahah
i admire your honesty in chosing to do the easy video  i myself  would have done the same 
that character  11 10  it is from hero academia 
this went from lwhy to minecraft mobs smash or pass 
pewdiepie with his old voice at 9 08
felix was the greatest that ever happened to sweden  and when he left  a whole country cried in unison  brofist 
0 01  that moment when the teacher speaks

bladee reference
this is a hate comment
when we getting a bandicam discount code 
                                   
john 
that is dissapointing and surprising that pewds is still keeping the  no politics  rule  even now  when he could do so much help by just spreading the word  is he afraid to lose part of his audience by picking a side 
treat people how you wana be treated pie die pie you did that to dhar man  
he never did anything wrong to dhar mann
how come pewds is still so fun to watch even after all these years
i do not know man ask god
dude  the nostalgia from this video  
i have not watched pewdiepie in a minute and this channel is still good
111 milions subs  nice
dead chanel   
monica is my fav pewdiepie song
drain game
a workout update video would be much appreciated
i like how pewdiepie sponsor moments are not boring  i watch every single one of them
when i was watching this i have a stuffed animal husky 
if you came for the smash or pass here it is 8 28
i loved that you did the brofist so much  i even rewatched it
i have an i idea on how to fix the dislike button so i am going to put a comment saying like this video click like on the the comment or dislike this video click like and then you will see how how many people like the two different comments or you can say like or dislike or even better if pewdiepie made the comment saying like or dislike comment
bladee 
was waiting for this comment
   amazing in a weird way
stop the hate    
honestly so supportive of your content  if it s fun for you it s fun for us   
if i told you that nordvpn is blocked in my country what should i do now to unblock nordvpn so it can unblock the apps and websites that i want to use them pewd
a workout update would be amazing please do  
also  i ll never get tired of watching felix laugh at himself   makes it even funnier 
consider where your soul will spend eternity  heaven or hell   you don t want to end up in hell because you rejected the sacrifice jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith   we are all guilty of sin   we lie  steal and look with lust in our hearts   we are all guilty before a holy and righteous god   god is not just all loving and overlook your sin   he is loving  but sin he will judge because he is perfectly good  the good news is god the father sent his son jesus christ who was perfectly holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of love for us   we can t keep the law we break most all commandments   but jesus fulfilled all by his perfect thoughts  words  deeds and motives for us because we could not  jesus loved all humans and god the father perfectly   turn  repent of your sin and confess your thankfulness for what jesus did for you   put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of christ   jesus was raised from death to give you new life  death has been defeated  out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                                                                           
me  28 years old just smiling like a complete goon at the intro song  same as every other time   love you felix  thanks for making so many people smile xo

i do not hate america just the evil government  that ruined my life  targeted me  and made me look bad  and all those who hurt my muslim brothers and sisters by the way american girls are fine   mmmmm  but  i want to ask how would serbs and americans feel if we muslims did to american and serbian girls stretch them out  as they did to ours  our women and young girls were raped in the most brutal ways in bosnia and  we  suffered the arms embargo on bosnia also  injustice also the srebrenica genocide will be talked about always i want some kind of justice for me and all muslim victims and well any victim of any injustice  i love the girls to much and i wish i can have one also kosovo is not serbia shows peace sign  many girls would tell me how ugly i am  even that is not my fault  i love them<3 <3
7 26 for people who might be wondering what  a goodbye from iranians to pewdiepie  meant well   long story short the government is trying to make all the noniranian social media unusable in iran   but the idea has been put off for now   they are claiming to get back to it   sorry if this was confusing cuz i do not have the right vocabulary and also the whole things confusing   also we already have to use vpns to watch  youtube videos  so they want to make the internet so slow that we cannot use it unless companies such as youtube or even google have a station  am i using the right word    in iran which is not going to happen 
i do not hate america just the evil government  that ruined my life  targeted me  and made me look bad  and all those who hurt my muslim brothers and sisters by the way american girls are fine   mmmmm  but  i want to ask how would serbs and americans feel if we muslims did to american and serbian girls stretch them out  as they did to ours  our women and young girls were raped in the most brutal ways in bosnia and  we  suffered the arms embargo on bosnia also  injustice also the srebrenica genocide will be talked about always i want some kind of justice for me and all muslim victims and well any victim of any injustice  i love the girls to much and i wish i can have one also kosovo is not serbia shows peace sign  many girls would tell me how ugly i am  even that is not my fault  i love them<3 <3

we love the vlog 
gaming chairs are not comfortable  they are mroe likely to cause you back and neck problems actually  i would not in a good concience promote that kind of merch  and you are too greedy to create normal office chair that is ergonomic and comfortable  because it does not look as good and it would not sell as good  also its more expensive than just get china supplier  that sell chairs like yours for 30  in bulk
funny vid as always poods   anyways are you planning on making a batman review   looks kind of dope   have not able to watch it coz of covid 
is he trying not to be loud or something

 rynk 4474 change  or do you mean become more sneaky with their racism and hate 
 themerman i mean change  i don t see where i stuttered  unless you can provide examples where he s been more  sneaky   i stand by my word  
 jennyjkl and that was extremely based
he his died inside what do you mean
nice
he changed so much lmao do not deny it  not exactly a bad thing but he changed big 
pewds  why are you deleting comments supporting ukraine  do you support russia  it seems so  support ukraine 
he has not changed like become big headed or extremely obnoxious like most do when they reach that financial break  felix is humble and 10 years ago he was still the same humble person  that is why his channel is so addicting  he grabs your attention with the character and makes you stay with the entertainment  also love his dogs 
he dropped the hard r in gamer rage wdym not problematic    
there is no cancel mob
remember when he said the n word lol
 rynk 4474 he still comments shit things about china so i do not know about that man
yes
these videos just seem so much more genuine  it got to a point i feel he was just doing the videos people liked and wasn t really enjoying it again but wanted to make viewers happy and the content they wanted  i love the videos since he s been back  feels like hanging with adult felix  he s grown  the contents grown  it s just nice 
finally  lwiay 
love  from india xd 
he is getting old yup
i d love to see a new workout video and maybe even talk a bit about your diet  your honest look at steroid use and unattainable physiques we see in the media was really refreshing and wasn t something i knew  and so seeing the gains you ve made naturally and finding out how i could get there one day would be awesome 
pewds is a self obsessed rich guy who wants you to care about his feelings  he is not a bad guy  but he does not project intellectualism as he wishes to do 
for good old times 
i spent an entire match in apex legends complaining about invisible hackers once  because whenever i hear someone firing   i turn to them and they seem to be inside the walls   i was wearing my headphones backwards 
i want you to be immortal swedish boy 
welcome back to lwhy  it is been   le while  
everybody  we will never ever let this channel die

if its a depot got to bite it
jackscepticeye s camera is inverted  that s why it appears his headphones are on backwards
i thought my 1k upvotes ahh was going to be in this video
pewds wants his fans to be nice to him  it is like when kazuma wanted to be treated like an mc
i predict pewds starting his own nation and it will be the start of the one world pewds order
got to apriciate how he talks to us his community makes this channel feel like a second family
so true
do not read my name   d  d
i liek anything poods make honestly
i literally forgot about this channel
he mentioned he watched the batman but didn t even share his opinion about it  
i unironically have  hey monica  as my alarm  everytime i wake up i feel like the strongest swedish man in the world  second to pewdiepie of course
he mentioned he watched the batman but didn t even share his opinion about it  
love you pewds  been here for 10 years  and you ve definitely helped me feel better in my dark days  we love you    thank you for all the amazing content all these years

i officially accept that pluto is better than the moon

pewds should try playing one block skyblock by ijaminecraft
pewds brags about chair again   i notice it is freaking orange again  i thought we had this color grading thing fixed a while back   tsk tsk tsk 
i just punched my phone for the brofist  
pewd s has the type of youtube channel everyone dreams of  successfully filming whatever he wants  cooking  sure  video games  great  philosophy  sounds good  memes  awesome 
no 
a pc  makes coockies  i knew it  how do i get it out  i could sell them  wait  i have a printer   yes that is it

drainer
bladee  be nice to me
be cool be cool your like a beast bro your awsome  
is it just me or everyone is getting sponsors by nord vpn lately
 
ah  i thought my depression will never go away 
ngl  i am 19 now and this just aesthetic 
being 20 and watching the lwiay intro does not hit the same   all the 19 year olds are 20 now can we change it please 
pewdiepie should do nopixel rp
yeaa i enjoy
the   you could win  joke pewds was doing always made me laugh so much
omg pls do smash or pass minecraft characters   love you sm
you are someone i look up to 
pewdiepie i haven t watch you for many yearrrrrrrs
seems hes becoming a youtube of the past now  well was a good run man
     
          
     
is it just me or we need just one last episode of fridays with pewds 
yay more edgar content 
but chinese do plant eggs  they are called century eggs coz they leave them down there so long  they are a delicacy  although they look very very wrong 
in iran we do use vpn to use youtube but the goverment is cutting the internet off  it means that we cannot even use vpn then 
        
be nice to everyone and pewdiepie
hey where are the meme edits every ten seconds  unwatchable
pewdiepie is the best
pew do vlogs plz
was looking for the bladee song
pewdie how do you think we got eggplants 
man his father watching his video is wholesome af
you are my go to youtuber  whenever i feel lonely and alone  i want to play your videos so i do not feel sad 
i do not know about you guys but alvin ring feels like it is been in lazy development because of the fact that they repeated the same enemy over and over again and i mean it as for bosses take a look at the bosses really take a look at them may say different name but if you look at the creature it is the same one do not get me wrong i enjoy the main bosses but everything else in the game seems to be a little buggy i jumped on a rock started floating a few seconds later it is like well apparently you were flying in the air and then just touched the ground now you are dead but it is like i jumped on a rock that is literally two feet 2 ft so how is that even fair hell a lot of the stuff in the game seems to be a little broken poise does not even exist like it states that it is there but as far as i have seen and been using my weapons it does not seem like it is really there like dark souls 3 was or bloodborne where you would be able to power through attacks because of i do not know the weapon or your armor this game none of that everything is just broken worse on pc i have been hearing i am playing on the ps5 and i am still finding it agitating that it is just so sketchy for a soul s game i really hope it was not the dark souls 2 creators that had a hand in this cuz if so they would explain why none of it seems to be functioning as a soul s game that would make total sense but that would mean i would have to hate it because i really hate the developers of dark souls 2 even though they are from software they are just a small group that had the idea to destroy it seriously they just really dark souls that is why they made bloodborne then they made dark souls 3 dark souls 2 is that bad
draaaaaiiiiiin gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaang
such gains bro
pewdiepie s are not nothing but a bitch lasanga
    
i was looking for a bladee song  but this video is good enough i guess
planting an egg makes the 100 year old eggs
anyone else miss bro fist
fridayyy with pewdiepie 
full version of smash or pass 100  that shit is hilarious  
we really love edgy and maya s vidsss  it s like family day vlog  so wholesome 
okay guys be nice to him do not baby his ass into the ground  
when pewdiepie looks at a meme and it suddenly moves on to something entirely different  feels like experiencing king crimson
all minecraft mobs even with modded ones for more watch time
pewds  please give us a good series again  hope to see it soon   d
nice video bro
pewdiepie realized that he is           loosing views so he started liway again
is that a bladee reference     
i want to make a comment but i do not know what to write
woahhh  its another friday with pewdiepie on an actual friday
my wife
dude you have not watched my hero academia 
me and my hunsband see this anime  and automatically think on you  pews   anim  name  how heavy are the dumbbells you lift 
                          
you should bring back 5 weird stuff online
lwaiy
how has pewds not created world peace yet 
hey youtube  the bots are killing the comment section  but we all know you don t care susan 
damn i have not heard that intro for quite a long time
of course someone planted an egg  how else would you get an eggplant 
lwiay intro rolls  me    
 pewdiepie i got a huaweii  do not even try giving me a vpn  its usless
 that is my left arm on the left    pewdiepie 2022
reminder to be nice to felix 
felix you look so good
if i see anyone being mean to felix  i swear to god   
4 47 ok pewds you r great keep it up   how bout that
111m subs but 1m views
this is the shortest 12 minutes of my life
2021   60 million sub difference   2022  90 million sub difference  fucking tseries creating google accounts  subbing to the channel  repeating the cycle  
pewds is ded
i love this channel and i haven t been watching the elden videos because everyone loves to watch different things so in the meantime i just go back and watch old pewdiepie videos instead of complaing about it because it makes me happy seeing a creator do what he wants not just to please others  we re all human and all like different things and there s nothing wrong with that  if someone told me to do something they like instead of something i like i would tell them to f off lmao so glad to see you doing what makes you happy   
do not read my name   d  d  d
 understandable 
broke my wrist got to ice it
this man straight up passed on the cow smh
i would really like an update for your workout that would be a good video
turned 19 this week after watching since i was literally 9  madness 
  
pewdiepie i am you big fan   i love your meme review and i love you also felix
pewds has the best negotiation skill for nordvpn    
i know we are being nice n junk but it really got to me when he said  the last 2 years   like it s still 2020  i had to check when the video was released  f
i want pewds to post another picture of him like flexing his muscle and sh t so that we could compare this one with the last one from a couple of month ago
stop
i said stoooooppppp      
pewds is just the most energetic swedish man after zlatan of course 
the character was from mha i strongly recommend it
pewds  i hate when people comment on things that are not even the point of the video pewds 2 seconds later  thanks for noticing my gains  guys   this is the type of comment i like to see 
i am nice
pewdiepie be in limit ok if you cross the limit you and your  channel will be lost so be in limit
be nice 2 me
would you smash or pass the like button
pudidi 
finally the reddit can stop crying
a workout update would be lovely 
pewds sad about his audience saying something slightly mean every once in a while jj   am i a joke to you 
when you plant an egg you get eggplant
be nice or else 
i actually skip the sponsor segment of videos quite often  guilty  but i always sit thru pewd s cuz it s just so entertaining i do not know  always hope for a edgar cameo to be honest 
always use youtube vanced  skipping in video ads does not hurt felix  do not worry
that moment when you realise you are 19
please continue doing what you do  it is really entertaining watching you do the videos that are chill and it is just you  i always look forward watching your videos  d sincerely  a 20 year old
why are your views so low

sooooo say if i live in russia and i used nord vpn i can still watch netfix    
amazing  
why is this trending on gaming 
i like you
the lwiay intro gives me so much nostalgia 
feels scary that one day these videos will stop coming  strange 
it s been a lwhile
do all of them 
no
gooooood 
moral of the story   be nice to pewds or you get no nudes 
when you minimize elden ring to watch this video 
when pewdiepie looks at a meme and it suddenly moves on to something entirely different  feels like experiencing king crimson
why it is trending on gaming  
i actually enjoyed nordvpn ad this time  d d d
pewds slowly turning into the male version of jenna marbles and i am here for it
jubilee on 1 weeb eliminates 6 cosplayers pls

yes
watching pewdiepie at this point  like  i get it  you did your time  you made it 
 
saludos pewde esta genial ver otro video de lwiay
as a iranian i agree that if every leader man had pewdiepie chair world peace would be come true till now

i m 19 now and i started watching when i was 11
same  watch since i was 12 years old and i am now 21
these comments  holy shit i m old
10 years for me 
i started when i was like 12 and i am 22 now
same here  well  i came to know if him since the bro fist  
his vids are so boring i do not know how people find pewdiepie entertaining lmao
pewds  why are you deleting comments supporting ukraine  do you support russia  it seems so
so you actually assumed he is  undying  and a  forever entertaining creator  he literally is putting extremely low effort into his videos  because he is retired  his videos are generally boring and extremely irritating and cringe and is focusing on promotions  he even stated he felt empty  and look at his statistics  he is barely getting any views compared to his subscribers on his videos 
pewdiepie is such an og amazing channel  i am so happy he still gets millions of views a decade later 
 user fc3jw8sd5l same here 
same 
me too i started watching at 12 and now i m 22  he is undeniably the most down to earth  truly nice guy  don t ever stop pewdsss<3
fr i ve been hooked ever since corpse party
brooo so true
yes
same here almost twenty gang rise aaahoooh

dude the long live the king
i don t always watch pewds but when i do i enjoy it
bought nord vpn and watched the legendary bitch lasagna  in india 
hahaha lol
to be honest been basically a year since i last watched pewds to be honest some vids are actually pretty nice and i m genuinely happy he s still the same pewds after so many years
i have been here since 2 mil  i m so glad his community let us him do whatever tf he wants without hate
these videos just seem so much more genuine  it got to a point i feel he was just doing the videos people liked and wasn t really enjoying it again but wanted to make viewers happy and the content they wanted  i love the videos since he s been back  feel like hanging with adult felix  he s grown  the contents grown  it s just nice 
 but can you do this  will never be a dead meme
i wish pewds would play those weird horror games like before  those were gold 
           
yo i have wartched you since 2012 but i miss you playing games  like ya i like this stuff too but mix it up with some horror games  i am watching this other youtuber who plays horror games and i can actually find authentic enough with a good enough personality like yours  and watching him makes me miss your beginings  your roots  i know everyone changes i do too  i am just saying my opinion  still love ya man and appreciate all you do  do not let all the haters get you down 
did you know the human race is a disgrace i mean we all know it to be honest  
fak karo
damn that intro music hits different

7 57 when i was little my grandparents had chickens  sometimes their chickens would be up in the trees  my grandparents told me that if you planted chicken eggs you would grow chicken trees 
it is been so long since we had  a lwiay episode i decided to play this one at quarter speed just to be able to savor it longer  not knowing if or when we might see another seeing pews even admits it has been forever since he uploaded a lwiay episode  the next may take infinity to drop  so  with that said   ill stretch this one out to  shorten the delay between now and the next lwiay episode 
hearing the lwiay intro again felt so good
pewds is good  good is good  good is pewds  good

most of this guy s time definitely went into rotoscoping that bish
wow  he even brought back the lwiay into  after calling it fridays with pewdiepie for like a year
pewds started this upload thinking it would be done tomorrow not realizing he doesn t have that old shit wifi he once used to 
book review pewds  love the more introspective stuff  
i kind of like it being called lwiay more
i miss his lwhy intro so bad
i finished watching the good place today  did y all know it mentions pewdiepie in it  
i have to be careful what games i can watch people play because i have epilepsy so it s nice to get videos that aren t pertaining to that  i m so so glad that he s doing his own thing though  i d definitely watch more of them if i could

ouh shiet i am 19
let us start a cult and call its  answer us pewds 
been a while since i watch pewdz but i love how it does not matter so he is still here and i can still watch
do not read my name   d  d
he never listens to our comments
today is a historical day fridays with pewdiepie is finally uploaded on friday  edit    3 11 2022
praise is the best motivator for good people 
i will never be nice to anyone so long as everyone keeps forgetting about me
seems like felix really is transitioning to a more chill upload schedule  which is awesome  maybe he can do a 6 month video upload like jontron and to the completely dissapear  like jontron jajajajaj 
i really missed this series  now that it is back  i started to watch pewds again
do not read my name   d  d
you are so funny you got badass guns

i thought we were doing fridays with pewdiepie 
pewds starting a lwiay and reading about lwiay being dead
    one of the best thing about dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he achieves something  he always respect us  the audience and his team  and he is polite in all his videos  we congratulate ourselves on this achievement more to

lol your comment got copied by a bot
due lwiay happy face me has
pewds the reason we love watching vlogs now is because we were once 9 year olds but now we have grown older with your channel and we enjoy watching the vlogs more and we all need more wholesome stuff in todays world 
you are not bladee
pewds is so good that he tell us to call him a good person  
i do not watch him  but i sure do love to subscribe 
the title reminded me of bladee   
her in them jeans though  
ok
create a new car vlog felix
go on ksi s subreddit lmao
do not delete my new car nissong vlog
newbs
smash
maybe pewdiepie should do smash or pass on minecraft anime girl from mob talker
love you pewbs
these videos just seem so much more genuine  it got to a point i feel he was just doing the videos people liked and wasn t really enjoying it again but wanted to make viewers happy and the content they wanted  i love the videos since he s been back  feels like hanging with adult felix  he s grown  the contents grown  it s just nice 
i definitely love how laid back and natural his videos are  it is a stark difference to the rest of youtube
if you do not subscribe to this channel  you will not be lucky 
honestly just these relaxed chilled out videos where you feel like you are hanging out with a creator are my favorite types of videos  just having a good laugh or whatever with a  kind of  friend  very cautious calling him that because it feels kind of weird and he got mad at someone in the past lmao 
sometimes i fear is that pewdiepie works as some form of anger bank that when shitty things happen in the world people can then go and watch him like someone drawing water from a well  of wholesome content  but then that theory could be applied to youtube as app   changing wholesome with x then imputing with what ever data that app s algorithm uses and has generated from your interactions with it 
at this point let pewdiepie quit youtube
 corozan3080 he would if he wanted to  he s a plenty of money to stop when he wants  he chooses not to lol  don t quite get the point of this comment 
 instabruh user  bruh you don t even have videos
he has been grown for 8 years if you count 24 as grown
100  agree with you   
do not read my name   d  d
 catcatcatcat8046 it is a bot

lwiay is back 
thanks pewds  it is always a joy watching your videos  thanks for making my day a bit funnier

i think this guy wants us to be nice to him
i think piediepie should start a new minecraft series and call it  a fresh start 
i always see nord vpn ads but i use surfshark and have a 3 year contract sorta thing i have paid for  when it ends  i may opt for nord vpn but so far  surfshark is great so i see no reason to change  has anybody used both and could tell me whether one is better than the other 
lwiay is back

i like it
dude what he says at 3 52 is so true  lol i go to comments to see what people are saying about the video  so i hate when comment sections are just filled with essentially the same comment over and over about one tiny unimportant detail like backwards headphones  it is funny the first time you read it but gets old real quick when it is all there is
bladee
hey pewds  if you are going to do more book reviews  i know you like philosophy and focus mainly on non fiction  for about 15 years all i read was non fiction as well  but i think you would thoroughly enjoy  mother night  by kurt vonnegut as it raises a lot of philosophical questions 
play minecraft  defeat the warden in his own base  thn i will accept that you have big pee pee  
 lwiay is back   and also fridays with pewdiepie  woooooooo

weird stuff online   
i want to see a pewds song with him in cat girl get up
the   you could win  joke pewds was doing always made me laugh so much
if you do not subscribe to this channel  you will not be lucky
you are actually going to get a bit upset over the jack headphones comments when a good portion of your own content is making fun of stuff like that as was demonstrated by the first part of that meme  ngl i have been noticing recently pewds  you have a pretty significant ego problem  i think your fame and wealth has put you out of touch with reality  you seems to try really hard to pretend like your not  but the things that upset you  paint a pretty clear picture of the truth  i know you try and make a joke out of it but even still its so obvious i am surprised your little tantrums get left in the videos 
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
day 4 of asking pewdiepie to donate merch to mrbeast philanthropy
this is supposed to be fridays with pewdiepie  do not let him fool you

 looks at title  is pewds a drainer 
i have just realized that i think  based on hazy memories of high school  that i am approaching my ten year mark of watching pewdiepie   and i have just realised how that is a little less than half my life and i do not see it stopping until he does like holy shit i spent years here yearsssss its kind of nuts when you think it hard enough  in a weird way  its like my personality grew along with yours for me to always be so excited for a video 
woww you do not read my profile picture

but it s fridays with pewdiepie 
i love pugle
reading about people grabbing multi figures monthly as income in investments even in this crazy days in the market  any pointers on how to make substantial progress in earnings  would be appreciated  i will be in the comments
just shove into crypto you will be wealthy in the long run
am investing in crypto now the dip is a clear sign for new investors to come in
perfect you buy when the market is low to get profit when it rises
i wanted to trade crypto but got  confused by the fluctuations  in price
trading crypto with expert ali  has being a game changer for me
he is obviously the best i invested 2000usd with him and i made a profit of 9101usd
getting in with him just last week  am winning already so awesome 
i heard his strategies are really good
mr hamzah ali keeps delivering 
he has really made a good name for himself
how do i get at this 
 markjohnson kk1hn he is available  on wat app  
                   
trading crypto now will be very wise but trading without a professional is not
trading without a professional like  expert ali is like gambling with your money
i got expert ali info how good is he 
 edward st8qm thank you for this 
he is really an amazing trader  with amazing skills he changed my 0 3btc to 2 1btc
i have worked with 4 traders in the past but none of them is as efficient as he is   his  trading strategies are awesome  
i have never heard or seen any of his client complain of lost  i think he is just too perfect 
my weekly earning from his strategies are mind blowing  
without the help of expert  ali i would still be in abject poverty struggling with life 
10 years later and i still do not get tired of watching pewds videos  you are awesome felix  thank you for making my day throughout all those years 
pewds you should play chess
all jokes aside  do you plan on a book review again 
felix  i want to tell you how good you are  you look beefy in a thick way
fuck i remember everything was so nice even though my life is nothing but failure

well it did not play out because of so many people have tried to stop them   so it did not happend but it was close to be happened
 ericwenthome4880 ah  so that was about sianat   i was like totally forgetting that   thanks for explaining  
 shalale your welcome  
11 20 the anime is my hero academia

its nice seeing you do lwiay again pewds  hoping everything s going well for you and you can already move to japan 
 people discover things not because they are smart  but because they just try stupid sh  all the time  a hundred percent   like who tf was the mf that discovered cow milk  imagine them explaining it to other dudes

define nice 
thought the video title was a bladee rerfrence
thanks man i am from iran
he is spending too much time off the pc we need to glue him to it to make more videos
i think he knows that the title of the video is a bladee song
more fact here  vpn for pleasure
felix not recognizing tora from wild wild pussycats in mha is sadness   
i betcha pewds is reading my comment right now and just spent 3 seconds of his time on me  big appreciation on my part felix
i liked this video   its like coming home and talking with your best friend love you <3
pewds  these vpn ads are getting too scummy  the things you say in them are simply not true from a technology point of view  they are misleading and deceptive  i understand you are just reading a script to earn money  but please  be a bit more careful with these 
pewds  and that is my left arm on the left me  hmm yes the floor here is made out of floor   
please do a full smash or pass with no context
not a kid but love singing lwiay intro
don t be mean to him   
honestly  pewds could upload anything he wants  it is all fun  keep it up  
 
bladee reference bladee reference
i love that you said that you have been enjoying doing the videos with your dogs  they seriously give me jenna marble vibes  i absolutely adore all of your content though felix  keep up the good work

hey pewds  just wanted to tell you that seeing your gains and how much you have become a chad lately kind of motivated me to workout a little  keep on working those guns brother 
do not watch my first video    
drain gang
missed the intro 
i like how pewds makes ads entertaining
but peeeeewds it is sooooo annoying to see the slightest imperfection in any piece of media i consume because it reminds me that you are an actual human and not a perfect being  please take this into account and never make a mistake again
ok  i ll be nice to you 
legend

hey hey monika slaps
pleace say something about situation on ukraine 
hello
7 50 good czech
there  there mr  pie
hi
i am so tired of hearing about nord vpn for christ sake pewds take another sponser
pewd s has the type of youtube channel everyone dreams of  successfully filming whatever he wants  cooking  sure  video games  great  philosophy  sounds good  memes  awesome 
 blakecreed2272 ok
putin is the best   i am the best youtuber ever 
putin is the best   i am the best youtuber ever 
 nimbux  well  lots of utubers constantly stresses out when they switch content fearing lost of views   such
  he does it really well like even though he switches the type of content frequently it s still cohesive and i m able to enjoy everything he puts out  
roses are red violets are blue in addition to financial and military aid  the united states also provides large scale political support to israel  having used its united nations security council veto power 42 times against resolutions condemning israel  out of a total 83 times in which its veto has ever been used 
every comment says the same thing lol
you sound like your rating the channel not even complementing the video xd
not just for youtube but all forms of content creation  this is ideal 
the problem is youtube drastically downranks videos that are not focused  that is why you will see certain creators making multiple channels 
 aryanahampton that is because he built his channel for years focusing on a single thing at first which is videogames  who is to say his recent videos all did well  some could not generate enough revenue to sustain  but he could subsidize it by the wealth he has built before and recent content that is good  its never overnight  and if it is  they are lying 
e muito e ma a
do not read my name   d  d
felix  is not japan open their border now  are not you have a plan to go there  in case you did not know that
pewdiepie should make a butterfly knife trainer  please i am begging you

under 100k club letsgo
did i miss something or did we just randomly circle back to lwiay after rebranding it back to friday s with pewdiepie a few months ago lol
remember guys  we are laughing with him not against him
do not watch my first video    
 pewdiepie is fuuu  my content is way better       
putin is the best   i am the best youtuber ever 
facts
pewdiepie is honestly one of the few youtube channels that i wish will live on forever
do not watch my first video    
truuuue
what  do you want for him to record videos in his 80s 
 marcelo ol7lf i guess  i was referring to just his channel  but that would be nice too    i do not know what kind of content he would create but i am all down for watching wrinkly old felix review the newest gaming video  or whatever he is into at that age lol 
 marcelo ol7lf yes
does anyone want to eat dinner with me
it is the best youtuber phewde
i like pewdiepie because it is like you are talking to a real person  not a fake glorified ego driven youtuber
i just got the pewdiepie chair
iranians   saying their goodbyes because they are probably not going to be able to access youtube anymore  pewds   recommends nord vpn even though iranians cannot pay for it 
i literally wanted to comment exactly this
 pewdiepie is fuuu  my content is way better       
do not watch my first video    
i mean we already cannot watch without a vpn
welp   dude i am iranian and yes we always use vpn for youtube that does not effect us  
 arian6755 iranians cannot get anything because of sanctions  i m talking about purchasing nordvpn 
i mean we have been using vpn for ages becuz youtube is banned in here but the goodbye was for a new law that would not allow us to even use vpn  but it is fine  it did not pass  
dude wdym iranians cannot pay for it  you think fairly rich or even middle class people do not exist  in iran  funny seeing how the media can paint such a horrific picture of a country
 ronitjalihal2586 i will forgive you for your ignorance young one  we iranians cannot pay because our country is banned from using international credit cards  like master card  visa card  etc  meaning we cannot buy shit from countries outside our own  and we cannot get those cards even if we wanted to due our nationality
 leo v8214 heyyyy man   life i though in iran   we cannot even purchased our games
pie do you like cryptos  do you know shiba yacht club  let us take a rest and relax with this project lfggg
you are the cure to every heartbreak

i think felix did forget how to speak english  most of his sentences are mumbled and jumbled in this whole video xd
5 3k likes and 0 dislikes omg

omg pewds a bladee stan
i think you have watched a bit too much anime felix

i cannot join the floor gang because i live in russia   
tf2 players  no
browfist    loved the video
i got boulders on my shoulders collarbones begin to crack there is very little left of me and its never coming back there are certain things you ask of me and there are certain things i lack the beginning we were winning now were just making up facts what is it matter anymore if you believe the lies i tell there is no meaning to the words but we still sing these songs well if we all left it alone i am sure it would work itself out fine we keep plaing with the numbers we are running out of time you are a killer and i am your best friend i think its unfair your situation you say i am changing i am sorry i did not know i had to stay the same can we talk about this later your voice is driving me driving me insane
yes lwiay  <3 also  i am totally down for another workout vid  i think it would be cool to also hear about how you got started  choosing the right workouts for you  any diet changes you made  getting adjusted to including fitness in your life  etc  and if you encountered any difficulties on keeping up with this lifestyle  like  if you ever felt like you were not making progress or something like that  i understand that people do things differently and it may not work for everyone  but it is still interesting to hear   if you want lol 
this is assuming you have not talked about this before lol
i will always be nice to you  also the heck i was just watching a old liy lol
man this guy fell off  love you chad man
please is plain fortnite
remember that time when pewds was trippin so hard while playing outlast 2 because he kept putting his headphones on backwards  good times
omg lwiay is back
